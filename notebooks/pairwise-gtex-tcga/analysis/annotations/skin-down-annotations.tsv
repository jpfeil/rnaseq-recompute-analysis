BTAF1	9044	96.148445	9044.0	B-TFIID TATA-box binding protein associated factor 1		This gene encodes a TAF (TATA box-binding protein-associated factor), which associates with TBP (TATA box-binding protein) to form the B-TFIID complex that is required for transcription initiation of genes by RNA polymerase II. This TAF has DNA-dependent ATPase activity, which drives the dissociation of TBP from DNA, freeing the TBP to associate with other TATA boxes or TATA-less promoters.	BTAF1
TJP3	27134	96.719734	27134.0	tight junction protein 3		The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase-like (MAGUK) protein family which is characterized by members having multiple PDZ domains, a single SH3 domain, and a single guanylate kinase-like (GUK)-domain. In addition, members of the zonula occludens protein subfamily have an acidic domain, a basic arginine-rich region, and a proline-rich domain. The protein encoded by this gene plays a role in the linkage between the actin cytoskeleton and tight-junctions and also sequesters cyclin D1 at tight junctions during mitosis. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms. This gene has a partial pseudogene on chromosome 1.	TJP3

CHP2	63928	97.60815	63928.0	calcineurin like EF-hand protein 2		This gene product is a small calcium-binding protein that regulates cell pH by controlling plasma membrane-type Na+/H+ exchange activity. This protein shares sequence similarity with calcineurin B and can bind to and stimulate the protein phosphatase activity of calcineurin A (CnA) and functions in the calcineurin/NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cells) signaling pathway. Another member of the CHP subfamily, Calcineurin B homologous protein 1, is located on Chromosome 15 and is an inhibitor of calcineurin activity and has a genetic phenotype associated with Parkinson's Disease (OMIM:606988). This gene was initially identified as a tumor-associated antigen and was previously referred to as Hepatocellular carcinoma-associated antigen 520.	CHP2

KLF4	9314	99.44176	9314.0	Kruppel like factor 4		This gene encodes a protein that belongs to the Kruppel family of transcription factors. The encoded zinc finger protein is required for normal development of the barrier function of skin. The encoded protein is thought to control the G1-to-S transition of the cell cycle following DNA damage by mediating the tumor suppressor gene p53. Mice lacking this gene have a normal appearance but lose weight rapidly, and die shortly after birth due to fluid evaporation resulting from compromised epidermal barrier function. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms.	KLF4

NHS	4810	96.43789	4810.0	NHS actin remodeling regulator		This gene encodes a protein containing four conserved nuclear localization signals. The encoded protein functions in eye, tooth, craniofacial and brain development, and it can regulate actin remodeling and cell morphology. Mutations in this gene have been shown to cause Nance-Horan syndrome, and also X-linked cataract-40. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been described for this gene.	NHS
VIPR1	7433	93.84546	7433.0	vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor 1		This gene encodes a receptor for vasoactive intestinal peptide, a small neuropeptide. Vasoactive intestinal peptide is involved in smooth muscle relaxation, exocrine and endocrine secretion, and water and ion flux in lung and intestinal epithelia. Its actions are effected through integral membrane receptors associated with a guanine nucleotide binding protein which activates adenylate cyclase. Several transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.	VIPR1
ZNF711	7552	92.26306	7552.0	zinc finger protein 711		This gene encodes a zinc finger protein of unknown function.

HSD11B2	3291	93.67235	3291.0	hydroxysteroid 11-beta dehydrogenase 2		There are at least two isozymes of the corticosteroid 11-beta-dehydrogenase, a microsomal enzyme complex responsible for the interconversion of cortisol and cortisone. The type I isozyme has both 11-beta-dehydrogenase (cortisol to cortisone) and 11-oxoreductase (cortisone to cortisol) activities. The type II isozyme, encoded by this gene, has only 11-beta-dehydrogenase activity. In aldosterone-selective epithelial tissues such as the kidney, the type II isozyme catalyzes the glucocorticoid cortisol to the inactive metabolite cortisone, thus preventing illicit activation of the mineralocorticoid receptor. In tissues that do not express the mineralocorticoid receptor, such as the placenta and testis, it protects cells from the growth-inhibiting and/or pro-apoptotic effects of cortisol, particularly during embryonic development. Mutations in this gene cause the syndrome of apparent mineralocorticoid excess and hypertension.	HSD11B2
KLF8	11279	96.72214	11279.0	Kruppel like factor 8		This gene encodes a protein which is a member of the Sp/KLF family of transcription factors. Members of this family contain a C-terminal DNA-binding domain with three Kruppel-like zinc fingers. The encoded protein is thought to play an important role in the regulation of epithelial to mesenchymal transition, a process which occurs normally during development but also during metastasis. A pseudogene has been identified on chromosome 16. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.	KLF8
WNT2B	7482	96.419785	7482.0	Wnt family member 2B		This gene encodes a member of the wingless-type MMTV integration site (WNT) family of highly conserved, secreted signaling factors. WNT family members function in a variety of developmental processes including regulation of cell growth and differentiation and are characterized by a WNT-core domain. This gene may play a role in human development as well as carcinogenesis. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.	WNT2B

The encoded protein forms homodimers or heterodimers with other PAR family members and binds sequence-specific promoter elements to activate transcription. Chromosomal translocations fusing portions of this gene with the E2A gene cause a subset of childhood B-lineage acute lymphoid leukemias. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been described, but their biological validity has not been determined.	HLF

CES4A	283848	99.44372	283848.0	carboxylesterase 4A		This gene encodes a member of the carboxylesterase large family. The family members are responsible for the hydrolysis or transesterification of various xenobiotics, such as cocaine and heroin, and endogenous substrates with ester, thioester, or amide bonds. They also participate in fatty acyl and cholesterol ester metabolism, and may play a role in the blood-brain barrier system. This gene, also called CES6, encodes a secreted enzyme, and may play a role in the detoxification of drugs and xenobiotics in neural and other tissues of the body and in the cerebrospinal fluid. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been reported, but the full-length nature and/or biological validity of some variants have not been determined.	CES4A
BCL6	604	93.869865	604.0	B-cell CLL/lymphoma 6		The protein encoded by this gene is a zinc finger transcription factor and contains an N-terminal POZ domain. This protein acts as a sequence-specific repressor of transcription, and has been shown to modulate the transcription of STAT-dependent IL-4 responses of B cells. This protein can interact with a variety of POZ-containing proteins that function as transcription corepressors. This gene is found to be frequently translocated and hypermutated in diffuse large-cell lymphoma (DLCL), and may be involved in the pathogenesis of DLCL. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different protein isoforms have been found for this gene.	BCL6
ABCC3	8714	95.88202	8714.0	ATP binding cassette subfamily C member 3		The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the superfamily of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. ABC proteins transport various molecules across extra- and intra-cellular membranes. ABC genes are divided into seven distinct subfamilies (ABC1, MDR/TAP, MRP, ALD, OABP, GCN20, White). This protein is a member of the MRP subfamily which is involved in multi-drug resistance. The specific function of this protein has not yet been determined; however, this protein may play a role in the transport of biliary and intestinal excretion of organic anions. Alternatively spliced variants which encode different protein isoforms have been described; however, not all variants have been fully characterized.	ABCC3
