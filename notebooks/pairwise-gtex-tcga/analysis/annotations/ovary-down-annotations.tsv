Diversification of these genes has occurred in regions encoding substrate-binding domains, as well as in tissue expression patterns, to accommodate an increasing number of foreign compounds.	GSTM5
PRRT2	112476	99.027435	112476.0	proline rich transmembrane protein 2	This gene encodes a transmembrane protein containing a proline-rich domain in its N-terminal half. Studies in mice suggest that it is predominantly expressed in brain and spinal cord in embryonic and postnatal stages. Mutations in this gene are associated with episodic kinesigenic dyskinesia-1. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.	PRRT2
ABCA6	23460	97.941986	23460.0	ATP binding cassette subfamily A member 6	The membrane-associated protein encoded by this gene is a member of the superfamily of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. ABC proteins transport various molecules across extra- and intracellular membranes. ABC genes are divided into seven distinct subfamilies (ABC1, MDR/TAP, MRP, ALD, OABP, GCN20, and White). This encoded protein is a member of the ABC1 subfamily. Members of the ABC1 subfamily comprise the only major ABC subfamily found exclusively in multicellular eukaryotes. This gene is clustered among 4 other ABC1 family members on 17q24 and may play a role in macrophage lipid homeostasis.	ABCA6
STAT5B	6777	102.980034	6777.0	signal transducer and activator of transcription 5B	The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the STAT family of transcription factors. In response to cytokines and growth factors, STAT family members are phosphorylated by the receptor associated kinases, and then form homo- or heterodimers that translocate to the cell nucleus where they act as transcription activators. This protein mediates the signal transduction triggered by various cell ligands, such as IL2, IL4, CSF1, and different growth hormones. It has been shown to be involved in diverse biological processes, such as TCR signaling, apoptosis, adult mammary gland development, and sexual dimorphism of liver gene expression. This gene was found to fuse to retinoic acid receptor-alpha (RARA) gene in a small subset of acute promyelocytic leukemias (APLL). The dysregulation of the signaling pathways mediated by this protein may be the cause of the APLL.	STAT5B
CHRD	8646	95.40366	8646.0	chordin	This gene encodes a secreted protein that dorsalizes early vertebrate embryonic tissues by binding to ventralizing TGF-beta-like bone morphogenetic proteins and sequestering them in latent complexes. The encoded protein may also have roles in organogenesis and during adulthood. It has been suggested that this gene could be a candidate gene for Cornelia de Lange syndrome. Reduced expression of this gene results in enhanced bone regeneration. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. Other alternative splice variants have been described but their full length sequence has not been determined.	CHRD
TUBGCP6	85378	92.58919	85378.0	tubulin gamma complex associated protein 6	The protein encoded by this gene is part of a large multisubunit complex required for microtubule nucleation at the centrosome.	TUBGCP6
PEG3	5178	100.283905	5178.0	paternally expressed 3	In human, ZIM2 and PEG3 are treated as two distinct genes though they share multiple 5' exons and a common promoter and both genes are paternally expressed (PMID:15203203). Alternative splicing events connect their shared 5' exons either with the remaining 4 exons unique to ZIM2, or with the remaining 2 exons unique to PEG3. In contrast, in other mammals ZIM2 does not undergo imprinting and, in mouse, cow, and likely other mammals as well, the ZIM2 and PEG3 genes do not share exons. Human PEG3 protein belongs to the Kruppel C2H2-type zinc finger protein family. PEG3 may play a role in cell proliferation and p53-mediated apoptosis. PEG3 has also shown tumor suppressor activity and tumorigenesis in glioma and ovarian cells. Alternative splicing of this PEG3 gene results in multiple transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms.

ABC proteins transport various molecules across extra- and intracellular membranes. ABC genes are divided into seven distinct subfamilies (ABC1, MDR/TAP, MRP, ALD, OABP, GCN20, and White). This gene is a member of the ABC1 subfamily and is clustered with four other ABC1 family members on chromosome 17q24. Transcriptional expression of this gene is induced during monocyte differentiation into macrophages and is suppressed by cholesterol import.	ABCA9
FBXO31	79791	92.42447	79791.0	F-box protein 31	This gene is a member of the F-box family. Members are classified into three classes according to the substrate interaction domain, FBW for WD40 repeats, FBL for leucing-rich repeats, and FBXO for other domains. This protein, classified into the last category because of the lack of a recognizable substrate binding domain, has been proposed to be a component of the SCF ubiquitination complex. It is thought to bind and recruit substrate for ubiquitination and degradation. This protein may have a role in regulating the cell cycle as well as dendrite growth and neuronal migration. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.	FBXO31

SECISBP2	79048	92.40342	79048.0	SECIS binding protein 2	The incorporation of selenocysteine into a protein requires the concerted action of an mRNA element called a sec insertion sequence (SECIS), a selenocysteine-specific translation elongation factor and a SECIS binding protein. With these elements in place, a UGA codon can be decoded as selenocysteine. The gene described in this record encodes a nuclear protein that functions as a SECIS binding protein. Mutations in this gene have been associated with a reduction in activity of a specific thyroxine deiodinase, a selenocysteine-containing enzyme, and abnormal thyroid hormone metabolism. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants.	SECISBP2
