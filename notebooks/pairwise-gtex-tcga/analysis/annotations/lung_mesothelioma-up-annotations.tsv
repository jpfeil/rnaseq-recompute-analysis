NNAT	4826	102.980034	4826.0	neuronatin		The protein encoded by this gene is a proteolipid that may be involved in the regulation of ion channels during brain development.

ALDH1A2	8854	94.469025	8854.0	aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family member A2		This protein belongs to the aldehyde dehydrogenase family of proteins. The product of this gene is an enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of retinoic acid (RA) from retinaldehyde. Retinoic acid, the active derivative of vitamin A (retinol), is a hormonal signaling molecule that functions in developing and adult tissues. The studies of a similar mouse gene suggest that this enzyme and the cytochrome CYP26A1, concurrently establish local embryonic retinoic acid levels which facilitate posterior organ development and prevent spina bifida. Four transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been identified for this gene.	ALDH1A2
PLOD2	5352	95.3786	5352.0	procollagen-lysine,2-oxoglutarate 5-dioxygenase 2		The protein encoded by this gene is a membrane-bound homodimeric enzyme that is localized to the cisternae of the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The enzyme (cofactors iron and ascorbate) catalyzes the hydroxylation of lysyl residues in collagen-like peptides. The resultant hydroxylysyl groups are attachment sites for carbohydrates in collagen and thus are critical for the stability of intermolecular crosslinks. Some patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type VIB have deficiencies in lysyl hydroxylase activity. Mutations in the coding region of this gene are associated with Bruck syndrome. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms.	PLOD2
SLC9A3R1	9368	97.29808	9368.0	SLC9A3 regulator 1		This gene encodes a sodium/hydrogen exchanger regulatory cofactor.

CNOT7	29883	92.57009	29883.0	CCR4-NOT transcription complex subunit 7		The protein encoded by this gene binds to an anti-proliferative protein, B-cell translocation protein 1, which negatively regulates cell proliferation. Binding of the two proteins, which is driven by phosphorylation of the anti-proliferative protein, causes signaling events in cell division that lead to changes in cell proliferation associated with cell-cell contact. The encoded protein downregulates the innate immune response and therefore provides a therapeutic target for enhancing its antimicrobial activity against foreign agents. Alternative splicing of this gene results in multiple transcript variants. Related pseudogenes have been identified on chromosomes 1 and X.	CNOT7
ITGB4	3691	94.91232	3691.0	integrin subunit beta 4		Integrins are heterodimers comprised of alpha and beta subunits, that are noncovalently associated transmembrane glycoprotein receptors. Different combinations of alpha and beta polypeptides form complexes that vary in their ligand-binding specificities. Integrins mediate cell-matrix or cell-cell adhesion, and transduced signals that regulate gene expression and cell growth. This gene encodes the integrin beta 4 subunit, a receptor for the laminins. This subunit tends to associate with alpha 6 subunit and is likely to play a pivotal role in the biology of invasive carcinoma. Mutations in this gene are associated with epidermolysis bullosa with pyloric atresia. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been found for this gene.

The encoded protein has an N-terminal ER-signal sequence, two catalytically active thioredoxin (TRX) domains, two TRX-like domains and a C-terminal ER-retention sequence. The protein plays a role in the folding of nascent proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum by forming disulfide bonds through its thiol isomerase, oxidase, and reductase activity.	PDIA2
RTN3	10313	95.405426	10313.0	reticulon 3		This gene belongs to the reticulon family of highly conserved genes that are preferentially expressed in neuroendocrine tissues. This family of proteins interact with, and modulate the activity of beta-amyloid converting enzyme 1 (BACE1), and the production of amyloid-beta. An increase in the expression of any reticulon protein substantially reduces the production of amyloid-beta, suggesting that reticulon proteins are negative modulators of BACE1 in cells. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene, and pseudogenes of this gene are located on chromosomes 4 and 12.	RTN3
LGALS3BP	3959	102.980034	3959.0	galectin 3 binding protein		The galectins are a family of beta-galactoside-binding proteins implicated in modulating cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. LGALS3BP has been found elevated in the serum of patients with cancer and in those infected by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

This protein is a neuron-specific protein and is the N-acetylaspartate (NAA) biosynthetic enzyme, catalyzing the NAA synthesis from L-aspartate and acetyl-CoA. NAA is a major storage and transport form of acetyl coenzyme A specific to the nervous system. The gene mutation results in primary NAA deficiency (hypoacetylaspartia).	NAT8L

The encoded protein plays a role in the 3' end processing of histone transcripts. This protein is one of the targets in the autoimmune disease systemic lupus erythematosus, and mutations in this gene have been associated with hypotrichosis. Several pseudogenes of this gene have been identified.	SNRPE
CA9	768	97.29176	768.0	carbonic anhydrase 9		Carbonic anhydrases (CAs) are a large family of zinc metalloenzymes that catalyze the reversible hydration of carbon dioxide. They participate in a variety of biological processes, including respiration, calcification, acid-base balance, bone resorption, and the formation of aqueous humor, cerebrospinal fluid, saliva, and gastric acid. They show extensive diversity in tissue distribution and in their subcellular localization. CA IX is a transmembrane protein and is one of only two tumor-associated carbonic anhydrase isoenzymes known. It is expressed in all clear-cell renal cell carcinoma, but is not detected in normal kidney or most other normal tissues. It may be involved in cell proliferation and transformation. This gene was mapped to 17q21.2 by fluorescence in situ hybridization, however, radiation hybrid mapping localized it to 9p13-p12.	CA9
BNC1	646	95.88572	646.0	basonuclin 1		The protein encoded by this gene is a zinc finger protein present in the basal cell layer of the epidermis and in hair follicles. It is also found in abundance in the germ cells of testis and ovary. This protein is thought to play a regulatory role in keratinocyte proliferation and it may also be a regulator for rRNA transcription. Alternative splicing of this gene results in multiple transcript variants, and multiple polyadenylation sites are indicated.	BNC1
SLC16A1	6566	97.29808	6566.0	solute carrier family 16 member 1		The protein encoded by this gene is a proton-linked monocarboxylate transporter that catalyzes the movement of many monocarboxylates, such as lactate and pyruvate, across the plasma membrane. Mutations in this gene are associated with erythrocyte lactate transporter defect. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this gene.	SLC16A1
PTPRF	5792	96.41671	5792.0	protein tyrosine phosphatase, receptor type F		The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) family. PTPs are known to be signaling molecules that regulate a variety of cellular processes including cell growth, differentiation, mitotic cycle, and oncogenic transformation. This PTP possesses an extracellular region, a single transmembrane region, and two tandem intracytoplasmic catalytic domains, and thus represents a receptor-type PTP. The extracellular region contains three Ig-like domains, and nine non-Ig like domains similar to that of neural-cell adhesion molecule. This PTP was shown to function in the regulation of epithelial cell-cell contacts at adherents junctions, as well as in the control of beta-catenin signaling. An increased expression level of this protein was found in the insulin-responsive tissue of obese, insulin-resistant individuals, and may contribute to the pathogenesis of insulin resistance. Two alternatively spliced transcript variants of this gene, which encode distinct proteins, have been reported.	PTPRF
