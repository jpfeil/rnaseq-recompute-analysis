SFTPB	6439	99.424965	6439.0	surfactant protein B		This gene encodes the pulmonary-associated surfactant protein B (SPB), an amphipathic surfactant protein essential for lung function and homeostasis after birth. Pulmonary surfactant is a surface-active lipoprotein complex composed of 90% lipids and 10% proteins which include plasma proteins and apolipoproteins SPA, SPB, SPC and SPD. The surfactant is secreted by the alveolar cells of the lung and maintains the stability of pulmonary tissue by reducing the surface tension of fluids that coat the lung. The SPB enhances the rate of spreading and increases the stability of surfactant monolayers in vitro. Multiple mutations in this gene have been identified, which cause pulmonary surfactant metabolism dysfunction type 1, also called pulmonary alveolar proteinosis due to surfactant protein B deficiency, and are associated with fatal respiratory distress in the neonatal period. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding the same protein have been identified.	SFTPB

MRPS25	64432	95.405426	64432.0	mitochondrial ribosomal protein S25		Mammalian mitochondrial ribosomal proteins are encoded by nuclear genes and help in protein synthesis within the mitochondrion. Mitochondrial ribosomes (mitoribosomes) consist of a small 28S subunit and a large 39S subunit. They have an estimated 75% protein to rRNA composition compared to prokaryotic ribosomes, where this ratio is reversed. Another difference between mammalian mitoribosomes and prokaryotic ribosomes is that the latter contain a 5S rRNA. Among different species, the proteins comprising the mitoribosome differ greatly in sequence, and sometimes in biochemical properties, which prevents easy recognition by sequence homology.

SYNE4	163183	101.78937	163183.0	spectrin repeat containing nuclear envelope family member 4		This gene is a member of the nesprin family of genes, that encode KASH (Klarsicht, Anc-1, Syne Homology) domain-containing proteins. In addition to the KASH domain, this protein also contains a coiled-coil and leucine zipper region, a spectrin repeat, and a kinesin-1 binding region. This protein localizes to the outer nuclear membrane, and is part of the linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton (LINC) complex in the nuclear envelope.
