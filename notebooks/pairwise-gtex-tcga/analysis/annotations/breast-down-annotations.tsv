HIF3A	64344	94.935585	64344.0	hypoxia inducible factor 3 alpha subunit		The protein encoded by this gene is the alpha-3 subunit of one of several alpha/beta-subunit heterodimeric transcription factors that regulate many adaptive responses to low oxygen tension (hypoxia). The alpha-3 subunit lacks the transactivation domain found in factors containing either the alpha-1 or alpha-2 subunits. It is thought that factors containing the alpha-3 subunit are negative regulators of hypoxia-inducible gene expression. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this gene.	HIF3A

The approved human gene nomenclature for the family is FXYD-domain containing ion transport regulator. Mouse FXYD5 has been termed RIC (Related to Ion Channel). FXYD2, also known as the gamma subunit of the Na,K-ATPase, regulates the properties of that enzyme. FXYD1 (phospholemman), FXYD2 (gamma), FXYD3 (MAT-8), FXYD4 (CHIF), and FXYD5 (RIC) have been shown to induce channel activity in experimental expression systems. Transmembrane topology has been established for two family members (FXYD1 and FXYD2), with the N-terminus extracellular and the C-terminus on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. The protein encoded by this gene is a plasma membrane substrate for several kinases, including protein kinase A, protein kinase C, NIMA kinase, and myotonic dystrophy kinase.

PER1	5187	96.16833	5187.0	period circadian clock 1		This gene is a member of the Period family of genes and is expressed in a circadian pattern in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, the primary circadian pacemaker in the mammalian brain. Genes in this family encode components of the circadian rhythms of locomotor activity, metabolism, and behavior. This gene is upregulated by CLOCK/ARNTL heterodimers but then represses this upregulation in a feedback loop using PER/CRY heterodimers to interact with CLOCK/ARNTL. Polymorphisms in this gene may increase the risk of getting certain cancers. Alternative splicing has been observed in this gene; however, these variants have not been fully described.	PER1
SLC25A27	9481	95.62866	9481.0	solute carrier family 25 member 27		Mitochondrial uncoupling proteins (UCP) are members of the larger family of mitochondrial anion carrier proteins (MACP). UCPs separate oxidative phosphorylation from ATP synthesis with energy dissipated as heat, also referred to as the mitochondrial proton leak. UCPs facilitate the transfer of anions from the inner to the outer mitochondrial membrane and the return transfer of protons from the outer to the inner mitochondrial membrane. They also reduce the mitochondrial membrane potential in mammalian cells. Tissue specificity occurs for the different UCPs and the exact methods of how UCPs transfer H+/OH- are not known. UCPs contain the three homologous protein domains of MACPs. Transcripts of this gene are only detected in brain tissue and are specifically modulated by various environmental conditions. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.	SLC25A27

Mouse studies show that adenylate cyclase 4, along with adenylate cyclases 2 and 3, is expressed in olfactory cilia, suggesting that several different adenylate cyclases may couple to olfactory receptors and that there may be multiple receptor-mediated mechanisms for the generation of cAMP signals. Alternative splicing results in transcript variants.	ADCY4
ROBO3	64221	96.99137	64221.0	roundabout guidance receptor 3		This gene is a member of the Roundabout (ROBO) gene family that controls neurite outgrowth, growth cone guidance, and axon fasciculation. ROBO proteins are a subfamily of the immunoglobulin transmembrane receptor superfamily. SLIT proteins 1-3, a family of secreted chemorepellants, are ligands for ROBO proteins and SLIT/ROBO interactions regulate myogenesis, leukocyte migration, kidney morphogenesis, angiogenesis, and vasculogenesis in addition to neurogenesis. This gene, ROBO3, has a putative extracellular domain with five immunoglobulin (Ig)-like loops and three fibronectin (Fn) type III motifs, a transmembrane segment, and a cytoplasmic tail with three conserved signaling motifs: CC0, CC2, and CC3 (CC for conserved cytoplasmic). Unlike other ROBO family members, ROBO3 lacks motif CC1. The ROBO3 gene regulates axonal navigation at the ventral midline of the neural tube. In mouse, loss of Robo3 results in a complete failure of commissural axons to cross the midline throughout the spinal cord and the hindbrain. Mutations ROBO3 result in horizontal gaze palsy with progressive scoliosis (HGPPS); an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by congenital absence of horizontal gaze, progressive scoliosis, and failure of the corticospinal and somatosensory axon tracts to cross the midline in the medulla. Alternative transcript variants have been described but have not been experimentally validated.	ROBO3

LMOD1	25802	95.405426	25802.0	leiomodin 1		The leiomodin 1 protein has a putative membrane-spanning region and 2 types of tandemly repeated blocks.  The transcript is expressed in all tissues tested, with the highest levels in thyroid, eye muscle, skeletal muscle, and ovary. Increased expression of leiomodin 1 may be linked to Graves' disease and thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy.	LMOD1

ABCA8	10351	105.23398	10351.0	ATP binding cassette subfamily A member 8		The membrane-associated protein encoded by this gene is a member of the superfamily of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. ABC proteins transport various molecules across extra- and intracellular membranes. ABC genes are divided into seven distinct subfamilies (ABC1, MDR/TAP, MRP, ALD, OABP, GCN20, White). This protein is a member of the ABC1 subfamily. Members of the ABC1 subfamily comprise the only major ABC subfamily found exclusively in multicellular eukaryotes. The encoded protein may regulate lipid metabolism and be involved in the formation and maintenance of myelin. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.	ABCA8
ABCA9	10350	98.28649	10350.0	ATP binding cassette subfamily A member 9		This gene is a member of the superfamily of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters and the encoded protein contains two transmembrane domains and two nucleotide binding folds. ABC proteins transport various molecules across extra- and intracellular membranes. ABC genes are divided into seven distinct subfamilies (ABC1, MDR/TAP, MRP, ALD, OABP, GCN20, and White). This gene is a member of the ABC1 subfamily and is clustered with four other ABC1 family members on chromosome 17q24. Transcriptional expression of this gene is induced during monocyte differentiation into macrophages and is suppressed by cholesterol import.	ABCA9

LCAT	3931	94.707214	3931.0	lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase		This gene encodes the extracellular cholesterol esterifying enzyme, lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase. The esterification of cholesterol is required for cholesterol transport. Mutations in this gene have been found to cause fish-eye disease as well as LCAT deficiency.	LCAT

PHYKPL	85007	95.38554	85007.0	5-phosphohydroxy-L-lysine phospho-lyase		This is a nuclear gene encoding a mitochondrial enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of 5-phosphonooxy-L-lysine to ammonia, inorganic phosphate, and 2-aminoadipate semialdehyde. Mutations in this gene may cause phosphohydroxylysinuria. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.	PHYKPL
AMY2B	280	108.35193	280.0	amylase, alpha 2B (pancreatic)		Amylases are secreted proteins that hydrolyze 1,4-alpha-glucoside bonds in oligosaccharides and polysaccharides, and thus catalyze the first step in digestion of dietary starch and glycogen. The human genome has a cluster of several amylase genes that are expressed at high levels in either salivary gland or pancreas. This gene encodes an amylase isoenzyme produced by the pancreas.	AMY2B

CFD	1675	100.75373	1675.0	complement factor D		This gene encodes a member of the S1, or chymotrypsin, family of serine peptidases. This protease catalyzes the cleavage of factor B, the rate-limiting step of the alternative pathway of complement activation. This protein also functions as an adipokine, a cell signaling protein secreted by adipocytes, which regulates insulin secretion in mice. Mutations in this gene underlie complement factor D deficiency, which is associated with recurrent bacterial meningitis infections in human patients. Alternative splicing of this gene results in multiple transcript variants. At least one of these variants encodes a preproprotein that is proteolytically processed to generate the mature protease.
