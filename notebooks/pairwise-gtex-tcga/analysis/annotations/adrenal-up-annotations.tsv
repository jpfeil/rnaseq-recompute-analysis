UBL5	59286	95.40171	59286.0	ubiquitin like 5		This gene encodes a member of a group of proteins similar to ubiquitin. The encoded protein is not thought to degrade proteins like ubiquitin but to affect their function through being bound to target proteins by an isopeptide bond. The gene product has been studied as a link to predisposition to obesity based on its expression in Psammomys obesus, the fat sand rat, which is an animal model for obesity studies. Variation in this gene was found to be significantly associated with some metabolic traits (PMID: 15331561) but not associated with childhood obesity (PMID: 19189687). Pseudogenes of this gene are located on chromosomes 3, 5 and 17. Multiple alternatively spliced variants, encoding the same protein, have been identified.	UBL5
NUTF2	10204	95.16694	10204.0	nuclear transport factor 2		This gene encodes a cytosolic factor that facilitates protein transport into the nucleus.

PCDHGB4	8641	113.74823	8641.0	protocadherin gamma subfamily B, 4		This gene is a member of the protocadherin gamma gene cluster, one of three related clusters tandemly linked on chromosome five. These gene clusters have an immunoglobulin-like organization, suggesting that a novel mechanism may be involved in their regulation and expression. The gamma gene cluster includes 22 genes divided into 3 subfamilies. Subfamily A contains 12 genes, subfamily B contains 7 genes and 2 pseudogenes, and the more distantly related subfamily C contains 3 genes. The tandem array of 22 large, variable region exons are followed by a constant region, containing 3 exons shared by all genes in the cluster. Each variable region exon encodes the extracellular region, which includes 6 cadherin ectodomains and a transmembrane region. The constant region exons encode the common cytoplasmic region. These neural cadherin-like cell adhesion proteins most likely play a critical role in the establishment and function of specific cell-cell connections in the brain. This particular family member is expressed in fibroblasts and is thought to play a role in wound healing in response to injury. Alternative splicing has been described for the gamma cluster genes.

ARL2BP	23568	94.71092	23568.0	ADP ribosylation factor like GTPase 2 binding protein		ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF)-like proteins (ARLs) comprise a functionally distinct group of the ARF family of RAS-related GTPases. The protein encoded by this gene binds to ARL2.GTP with high affinity but does not interact with ARL2.GDP, activated ARF, or RHO proteins. The lack of detectable membrane association of this protein or ARL2 upon activation of ARL2 is suggestive of actions distinct from those of the ARFs. This protein is considered to be the first ARL2-specific effector identified, due to its interaction with ARL2.GTP but lack of ARL2 GTPase-activating protein activity.	ARL2BP
PRPF6	24148	94.71092	24148.0	pre-mRNA processing factor 6		The protein encoded by this gene appears to be involved in pre-mRNA splicing, possibly acting as a bridging factor between U5 and U4/U6 snRNPs in formation of the spliceosome.

MRPL51	51258	95.382614	51258.0	mitochondrial ribosomal protein L51		Mammalian mitochondrial ribosomal proteins are encoded by nuclear genes and help in protein synthesis within the mitochondrion. Mitochondrial ribosomes (mitoribosomes) consist of a small 28S subunit and a large 39S subunit. They have an estimated 75% protein to rRNA composition compared to prokaryotic ribosomes, where this ratio is reversed. Another difference between mammalian mitoribosomes and prokaryotic ribosomes is that the latter contain a 5S rRNA. Among different species, the proteins comprising the mitoribosome differ greatly in sequence, and sometimes in biochemical properties, which prevents easy recognition by sequence homology. This gene encodes a 39S subunit protein. Pseudogenes corresponding to this gene are found on chromosomes 4p and 21q.	MRPL51

This protein has been shown to form a stable complex with CDK4 or CDK6, and prevent the activation of the CDK kinases, thus function as a cell growth regulator that controls cell cycle G1 progression. The abundance of the transcript of this gene was found to oscillate in a cell-cycle dependent manner with the lowest expression at mid G1 and a maximal expression during S phase. The negative regulation of the cell cycle involved in this protein was shown to participate in repressing neuronal proliferation, as well as spermatogenesis.

The protein encoded by this gene, along with regulatory factor X-associated protein and regulatory factor-5, forms a complex that binds to the X box motif of certain MHC class II gene promoters and activates their transcription. Once bound to the promoter, this complex associates with the non-DNA-binding factor MHC class II transactivator, which controls the cell type specificity and inducibility of MHC class II gene expression. This protein contains ankyrin repeats involved in protein-protein interactions. Mutations in this gene have been linked to bare lymphocyte syndrome type II, complementation group B. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been described for this gene.	RFXANK
PSENEN	55851	97.615074	55851.0	presenilin enhancer gamma-secretase subunit		Presenilins, which are components of the gamma-secretase protein complex, are required for intramembranous processing of some type I transmembrane proteins, such as the Notch proteins and the beta-amyloid precursor protein. Signaling by Notch receptors mediates a wide range of developmental cell fates. Processing of the beta-amyloid precursor protein generates neurotoxic amyloid beta peptides, the major component of senile plaques associated with Alzheimer's disease. This gene encodes a protein that is required for Notch pathway signaling, and for the activity and accumulation of gamma-secretase. Mutations resulting in haploinsufficiency for this gene cause familial acne inversa-2 (ACNINV2). Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.	PSENEN
HSBP1	3281	95.6279	3281.0	heat shock factor binding protein 1		The heat-shock response is elicited by exposure of cells to thermal and chemical stress and through the activation of HSFs (heat shock factors) results in the elevated expression of heat-shock induced genes.  Heat shock factor binding protein 1 (HSBP1), is a 76-amino-acid protein that binds to heat shock factor 1(HSF1), which is a transcription factor involved in the HS response.  During HS response, HSF1 undergoes conformational transition from an inert non-DNA-binding monomer to active functional trimers. HSBP1 is nuclear-localized and interacts  with the active trimeric state of HSF1 to negatively regulate HSF1 DNA-binding activity. Overexpression of HSBP1 in mammalian cells represses the transactivation activity of HSF1. When overexpressed in C.elegans HSBP1 has severe effects on survival of the animals after thermal and chemical stress consistent with a role of HSBP1 as a negative regulator of heat shock response.

MRPS36	92259	96.14476	92259.0	mitochondrial ribosomal protein S36		Mammalian mitochondrial ribosomal proteins are encoded by nuclear genes and help in protein synthesis within the mitochondrion. The mitochondrial ribosome (mitoribosome) consists of a small 28S subunit and a large 39S subunit. They have an estimated 75% protein to rRNA composition compared to prokaryotic ribosomes, where this ratio is reversed. Another difference between mammalian mitoribosomes and prokaryotic ribosomes is that the latter contain a 5S rRNA. Among different species, the proteins comprising the mitoribosome differ greatly in sequence, and sometimes in biochemical properties, which prevents easy recognition by sequence homology. This gene encodes a 28S subunit protein. Pseudogenes corresponding to this gene are found on chromosomes 3p, 4q, 8p, 11q, 12q, and 20p.	MRPS36
