SMG7	9887	94.071815	9887.0	SMG7, nonsense mediated mRNA decay factor		This gene encodes a protein that is essential for nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD); a process whereby transcripts with premature termination codons are targeted for rapid degradation by a mRNA decay complex. The mRNA decay complex consists, in part, of this protein along with proteins SMG5 and UPF1. The N-terminal domain of this protein is thought to mediate its association with SMG5 or UPF1 while the C-terminal domain interacts with the mRNA decay complex. This protein may therefore couple changes in UPF1 phosphorylation state to the degradation of NMD-candidate transcripts. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms.	SMG7

Cyclins are important regulators of cell cycle transitions through their ability to bind and activate cyclin-dependent protein kinases. This member also belongs to the F-box protein family which is characterized by an approximately 40 amino acid motif, the F-box. The F-box proteins constitute one of the four subunits of the ubiquitin protein ligase complex called SCFs (SKP1-cullin-F-box), which function in phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitination. The F-box proteins are divided into 3 classes: Fbws containing WD-40 domains, Fbls containing leucine-rich repeats, and Fbxs containing either different protein-protein interaction modules or no recognizable motifs.

XRCC2
STIL	6491	95.905594	6491.0	SCL/TAL1 interrupting locus		This gene encodes a cytoplasmic protein implicated in regulation of the mitotic spindle checkpoint, a regulatory pathway that monitors chromosome segregation during cell division to ensure the proper distribution of chromosomes to daughter cells. The protein is phosphorylated in mitosis and in response to activation of the spindle checkpoint, and disappears when cells transition to G1 phase. It interacts with a mitotic regulator, and its expression is required to efficiently activate the spindle checkpoint. It is proposed to regulate Cdc2 kinase activity during spindle checkpoint arrest. Chromosomal deletions that fuse this gene and the adjacent locus commonly occur in T cell leukemias, and are thought to arise through illegitimate V-(D)-J recombination events. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.	STIL

ZBTB33	10009	95.90318	10009.0	zinc finger and BTB domain containing 33		This gene encodes a transcriptional regulator with bimodal DNA-binding specificity, which binds to methylated CGCG and also to the non-methylated consensus KAISO-binding site TCCTGCNA. The protein contains an N-terminal POZ/BTB domain and 3 C-terminal zinc finger motifs. It recruits the N-CoR repressor complex to promote histone deacetylation and the formation of repressive chromatin structures in target gene promoters. It may contribute to the repression of target genes of the Wnt signaling pathway, and may also activate transcription of a subset of target genes by the recruitment of catenin delta-2 (CTNND2). Its interaction with catenin delta-1 (CTNND1) inhibits binding to both methylated and non-methylated DNA. It also interacts directly with the nuclear import receptor Importin-alpha2 (also known as karyopherin alpha2 or RAG cohort 1), which may mediate nuclear import of this protein.

Two forms of this enzyme exist as likely products of a gene duplication event. The gene encoding this form, alpha, is localized to chromosome 17 and the beta gene is localized to chromosome 3. The gene encoding this enzyme functions as the target for several anticancer agents and a variety of mutations in this gene have been associated with the development of drug resistance.

The encoded cell surface receptor is activated through proteolytic cleavage of its extracellular amino terminus, resulting in a new amino terminus that acts as a tethered ligand that binds to an extracellular loop domain. Activation of the receptor has been shown to stimulate vascular smooth muscle relaxation, dilate blood vessels, increase blood flow, and lower blood pressure. This protein is also important in the inflammatory response, as well as innate and adaptive immunity.	F2RL1

The encoded protein is a transcriptional activator that binds directly to a specific recognition motif in the promoters of target genes. This protein acts downstream of multiple different signaling pathways and is regulated by post-translational modification. It may participate in both promoting and suppressing cell proliferation. Expression of this gene may be changed in a variety of different cancers and in cardiovascular disease. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.	KLF5

AURKA	6790	93.092	6790.0	aurora kinase A		The protein encoded by this gene is a cell cycle-regulated kinase that appears to be involved in microtubule formation and/or stabilization at the spindle pole during chromosome segregation. The encoded protein is found at the centrosome in interphase cells and at the spindle poles in mitosis. This gene may play a role in tumor development and progression. A processed pseudogene of this gene has been found on chromosome 1, and an unprocessed pseudogene has been found on chromosome 10. Multiple transcript variants encoding the same protein have been found for this gene.	AURKA
SIPA1L3	23094	96.43658	23094.0	signal induced proliferation associated 1 like 3		This gene belongs to the signal induced proliferation associated 1 family of genes, which encode GTPase-activating proteins specific for the GTP-binding protein Rap1. Rap1 has been implicated in regulation of cell adhesion, cell polarity, and organization of the cytoskeleton. Like other members of the family, the protein encoded by this gene contains RapGAP and PDZ domains. In addition, this protein contains a C-terminal leucine zipper domain. This gene is proposed to function in epithelial cell morphogenesis and establishment or maintenance of polarity. Consistently, expression of the protein in cell culture showed localization to cell-cell borders in apical regions, and downregulation of the gene in 3D Caco2 cell culture resulted in abnormal cell polarity and morphogenesis. Allelic variants of this gene have been associated with congenital cataracts in humans.	SIPA1L3

CCNB2	9133	97.63125	9133.0	cyclin B2		Cyclin B2 is a member of the cyclin family, specifically the B-type cyclins. The B-type cyclins, B1 and B2, associate with p34cdc2 and are essential components of the cell cycle regulatory machinery. B1 and B2 differ in their subcellular localization. Cyclin B1 co-localizes with microtubules, whereas cyclin B2 is primarily associated with the Golgi region. Cyclin B2 also binds to transforming growth factor beta RII and thus cyclin B2/cdc2 may play a key role in transforming growth factor beta-mediated cell cycle control.	CCNB2
CCNB1	891	97.29501	891.0	cyclin B1		The protein encoded by this gene is a regulatory protein involved in mitosis. The gene product complexes with p34(cdc2) to form the maturation-promoting factor (MPF). Two alternative transcripts have been found, a constitutively expressed transcript and a cell cycle-regulated transcript, that is expressed predominantly during G2/M phase. The different transcripts result from the use of alternate transcription initiation sites.	CCNB1
ECT2	1894	93.849464	1894.0	epithelial cell transforming 2		The protein encoded by this gene is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor and transforming protein that is related to Rho-specific exchange factors and yeast cell cycle regulators. The expression of this gene is elevated with the onset of DNA synthesis and remains elevated during G2 and M phases. In situ hybridization analysis showed that expression is at a high level in cells undergoing mitosis in regenerating liver. Thus, this protein is expressed in a cell cycle-dependent manner during liver regeneration, and is thought to have an important role in the regulation of cytokinesis. Several transcript variants encoding two different isoforms have been found for this gene.	ECT2
SPAST	6683	90.64408	6683.0	spastin		This gene encodes a member of the AAA (ATPases associated with a variety of cellular activities) protein family.
