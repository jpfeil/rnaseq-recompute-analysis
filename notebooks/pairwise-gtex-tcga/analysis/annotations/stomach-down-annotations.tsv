Ubiquitination involves at least three classes of enzymes: ubiquitin-activating enzymes, or E1s, ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, or E2s, and ubiquitin-protein ligases, or E3s. This gene encodes a member of the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme family. The encoded protein shares 100% sequence identity with the mouse counterpart. This gene is ubiquitously expressed, with high expression seen in adult muscle. Three alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been found for this gene.	UBE2G2
AMY2B	280	108.35193	280.0	amylase, alpha 2B (pancreatic)		Amylases are secreted proteins that hydrolyze 1,4-alpha-glucoside bonds in oligosaccharides and polysaccharides, and thus catalyze the first step in digestion of dietary starch and glycogen. The human genome has a cluster of several amylase genes that are expressed at high levels in either salivary gland or pancreas. This gene encodes an amylase isoenzyme produced by the pancreas.	AMY2B

SNRPN	6638	98.66611	6638.0	small nuclear ribonucleoprotein polypeptide N		The protein encoded by this gene is one polypeptide of a small nuclear ribonucleoprotein complex and belongs to the snRNP SMB/SMN family. The protein plays a role in pre-mRNA processing, possibly tissue-specific alternative splicing events. Although individual snRNPs are believed to recognize specific nucleic acid sequences through RNA-RNA base pairing, the specific role of this family member is unknown. The protein arises from a bicistronic transcript that also encodes a protein identified as the SNRPN upstream reading frame (SNURF). Multiple transcription initiation sites have been identified and extensive alternative splicing occurs in the 5' untranslated region. Additional splice variants have been described but sequences for the complete transcripts have not been determined. The 5' UTR of this gene has been identified as an imprinting center. Alternative splicing or deletion caused by a translocation event in this paternally-expressed region is responsible for Angelman syndrome or Prader-Willi syndrome due to parental imprint switch failure.

SGSM2	9905	94.707214	9905.0	small G protein signaling modulator 2		The protein encoded by this gene is a GTPase activator with activity towards RAB32 and RAB33B, which are regulators of membrane trafficking. The encoded protein inactivates RAB32 and can bind RAB9A-GTP, a protein required for RAB32 activation.	SGSM2

NICN1	84276	94.93187	84276.0	nicolin 1		This protein encoded by this gene localizes to the nucleus and is expressed in numerous tissues including brain, testis, liver, and kidney. This refseq contains genomic sequence in its 3' UTR which is not supported by experimental evidence. Computer predictions indicate that this region of the 3' UTR contains hairpin-forming self-complementary sequence which is possibly excised after transcription. This gene has a pseudogene on chromosome X.	NICN1
DXO	1797	95.88202	1797.0	decapping exoribonuclease		This gene localizes to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class III region on chromosome 6. The function of its protein product is unknown, but its ubiquitous expression and conservation in both simple and complex eukaryotes suggests that this may be a housekeeping gene.	DXO
