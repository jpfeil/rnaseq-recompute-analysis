DMPK	1760	96.72214	1760.0	dystrophia myotonica protein kinase		The protein encoded by this gene is a serine-threonine kinase that is closely related to other kinases that interact with members of the Rho family of small GTPases. Substrates for this enzyme include myogenin, the beta-subunit of the L-type calcium channels, and phospholemman. The 3' untranslated region of this gene contains 5-38 copies of a CTG trinucleotide repeat.

ROBO3	64221	96.99137	64221.0	roundabout guidance receptor 3		This gene is a member of the Roundabout (ROBO) gene family that controls neurite outgrowth, growth cone guidance, and axon fasciculation. ROBO proteins are a subfamily of the immunoglobulin transmembrane receptor superfamily. SLIT proteins 1-3, a family of secreted chemorepellants, are ligands for ROBO proteins and SLIT/ROBO interactions regulate myogenesis, leukocyte migration, kidney morphogenesis, angiogenesis, and vasculogenesis in addition to neurogenesis. This gene, ROBO3, has a putative extracellular domain with five immunoglobulin (Ig)-like loops and three fibronectin (Fn) type III motifs, a transmembrane segment, and a cytoplasmic tail with three conserved signaling motifs: CC0, CC2, and CC3 (CC for conserved cytoplasmic). Unlike other ROBO family members, ROBO3 lacks motif CC1. The ROBO3 gene regulates axonal navigation at the ventral midline of the neural tube. In mouse, loss of Robo3 results in a complete failure of commissural axons to cross the midline throughout the spinal cord and the hindbrain. Mutations ROBO3 result in horizontal gaze palsy with progressive scoliosis (HGPPS); an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by congenital absence of horizontal gaze, progressive scoliosis, and failure of the corticospinal and somatosensory axon tracts to cross the midline in the medulla. Alternative transcript variants have been described but have not been experimentally validated.	ROBO3

ABC proteins transport various molecules across extra- and intracellular membranes. ABC genes are divided into seven distinct subfamilies (ABC1, MDR/TAP, MRP, ALD, OABP, GCN20, and White). This gene is a member of the ABC1 subfamily and is clustered with four other ABC1 family members on chromosome 17q24. Transcriptional expression of this gene is induced during monocyte differentiation into macrophages and is suppressed by cholesterol import.	ABCA9

RUNX1T1	862	92.26131	862.0	RUNX1 translocation partner 1		This gene encodes a member of the myeloid translocation gene family which interact with DNA-bound transcription factors and recruit a range of corepressors to facilitate transcriptional repression. The t(8;21)(q22;q22) translocation is one of the most frequent karyotypic abnormalities in acute myeloid leukemia. The translocation produces a chimeric gene made up of the 5'-region of the runt-related transcription factor 1 gene fused to the 3'-region of this gene. The chimeric protein is thought to associate with the nuclear corepressor/histone deacetylase complex to block hematopoietic differentiation. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.	RUNX1T1
SEC31B	25956	95.3786	25956.0	SEC31 homolog B, COPII coat complex component		This gene encodes a protein of unknown function.

DDX17	10521	91.76965	10521.0	DEAD-box helicase 17		DEAD box proteins, characterized by the conserved motif Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp (DEAD), are putative RNA helicases. They are implicated in a number of cellular processes involving alteration of RNA secondary structure, such as translation initiation, nuclear and mitochondrial splicing, and ribosome and splicesosome assembly. Based on their distribution patterns, some members of this family are believed to be involved in embryogenesis, spermatogenesis, and cellular growth and division. This gene encodes a DEAD box protein, which is an ATPase activated by a variety of RNA species, but not by dsDNA. This protein, and that encoded by DDX5 gene, are more closely related to each other than to any other member of the DEAD box family. This gene can encode multiple isoforms due to both alternative splicing and the use of alternative translation initiation codons, including a non-AUG (CUG) start codon.	DDX17
LPIN3	64900	95.62466	64900.0	lipin 3		The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the lipin family of proteins, and all family members share strong homology in their C-terminal region. This protein is thought to form hetero-oligomers with other lipin family members, while one family member, lipin 1, can also form homo-oligomers. This protein contains conserved motifs for phosphatidate phosphatase 1 (PAP1) activity as well as a domain that interacts with a transcriptional co-activator. Lipin complexes act in the cytoplasm to catalyze the dephosphorylation of phosphatidic acid to produce diacylglycerol, which is the precursor of both triglycerides and phospholipids. Lipin complexes are also thought to regulate gene expression as transcriptional co-activators in the nucleus. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.	LPIN3

TRIM3	10612	96.16833	10612.0	tripartite motif containing 3		The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the tripartite motif (TRIM) family, also called the 'RING-B-box-coiled-coil' (RBCC) subgroup of RING finger proteins. The TRIM motif includes three zinc-binding domains, a RING, a B-box type 1 and a B-box type 2, and a coiled-coil region. This protein localizes to cytoplasmic filaments. It is similar to a rat protein which is a specific partner for the tail domain of myosin V, a class of myosins which are involved in the targeted transport of organelles. The rat protein can also interact with alpha-actinin-4. Thus it is suggested that this human protein may play a role in myosin V-mediated cargo transport.
