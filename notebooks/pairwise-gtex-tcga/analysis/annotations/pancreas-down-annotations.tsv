RBPJL	11317	94.05	11317.0	recombination signal binding protein for immunoglobulin kappa J region like		This gene encodes a member of the suppressor of hairless protein family. A similar protein in mouse is a transcription factor that binds to DNA sequences almost identical to that bound by the Notch receptor signaling pathway transcription factor recombining binding protein J. The mouse protein has been shown to activate transcription in concert with Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen-2. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.	RBPJL
P2RX1	5023	96.16593	5023.0	purinergic receptor P2X 1		The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the P2X family of G-protein-coupled receptors. These proteins can form homo-and heterotimers and function as ATP-gated ion channels and mediate rapid and selective permeability to cations. This protein is primarily localized to smooth muscle where binds ATP and mediates synaptic transmission between neurons and from neurons to smooth muscle and may being responsible for sympathetic vasoconstriction in small arteries, arterioles and vas deferens. Mouse studies suggest that this receptor is essential for normal male reproductive function. This protein may also be involved in promoting apoptosis.	P2RX1

DDX17	10521	91.76965	10521.0	DEAD-box helicase 17		DEAD box proteins, characterized by the conserved motif Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp (DEAD), are putative RNA helicases. They are implicated in a number of cellular processes involving alteration of RNA secondary structure, such as translation initiation, nuclear and mitochondrial splicing, and ribosome and splicesosome assembly. Based on their distribution patterns, some members of this family are believed to be involved in embryogenesis, spermatogenesis, and cellular growth and division. This gene encodes a DEAD box protein, which is an ATPase activated by a variety of RNA species, but not by dsDNA. This protein, and that encoded by DDX5 gene, are more closely related to each other than to any other member of the DEAD box family. This gene can encode multiple isoforms due to both alternative splicing and the use of alternative translation initiation codons, including a non-AUG (CUG) start codon.	DDX17

VIPR2	7434	91.773346	7434.0	vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor 2		This gene encodes a receptor for vasoactive intestinal peptide, a small neuropeptide. Vasoactive intestinal peptide is involved in smooth muscle relaxation, exocrine and endocrine secretion, and water and ion flux in lung and intestinal epithelia. Its actions are effected through integral membrane receptors associated with a guanine nucleotide binding protein which activates adenylate cyclase.	VIPR2

PDIA2	64714	97.01092	64714.0	protein disulfide isomerase family A member 2		This gene encodes a member of the disulfide isomerase (PDI) family of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) proteins that catalyze protein folding and thiol-disulfide interchange reactions. The encoded protein has an N-terminal ER-signal sequence, two catalytically active thioredoxin (TRX) domains, two TRX-like domains and a C-terminal ER-retention sequence. The protein plays a role in the folding of nascent proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum by forming disulfide bonds through its thiol isomerase, oxidase, and reductase activity.	PDIA2
HPN	3249	96.413475	3249.0	hepsin		This gene encodes a type II transmembrane serine protease that may be involved in diverse cellular functions, including blood coagulation and the maintenance of cell morphology. Expression of the encoded protein is associated with the growth and progression of cancers, particularly prostate cancer. The protein is cleaved into a catalytic serine protease chain and a non-catalytic scavenger receptor cysteine-rich chain, which associate via a single disulfide bond. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.	HPN

DPH1	1801	92.93369	1801.0	diphthamide biosynthesis 1		The protein encoded by this gene is an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of diphthamide, a modified histidine found only in elongation factor-2 (EEF2). Diphthamide residues in EEF2 are targeted for ADP-ribosylation by diphtheria toxin and Pseudomonas exotoxin A. Defects in this gene have been associated with both ovarian cancer and autosomal recessive intellectual disability with short stature, craniofacial, and ectodermal anomalies.	DPH1
OGT	8473	93.67365	8473.0	O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) transferase		This gene encodes a glycosyltransferase that catalyzes the addition of a single N-acetylglucosamine in O-glycosidic linkage to serine or threonine residues. Since both phosphorylation and glycosylation compete for similar serine or threonine residues, the two processes may compete for sites, or they may alter the substrate specificity of nearby sites by steric or electrostatic effects. The protein contains multiple tetratricopeptide repeats that are required for optimal recognition of substrates. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been found for this gene.	OGT

SECISBP2	79048	92.40342	79048.0	SECIS binding protein 2		The incorporation of selenocysteine into a protein requires the concerted action of an mRNA element called a sec insertion sequence (SECIS), a selenocysteine-specific translation elongation factor and a SECIS binding protein. With these elements in place, a UGA codon can be decoded as selenocysteine. The gene described in this record encodes a nuclear protein that functions as a SECIS binding protein. Mutations in this gene have been associated with a reduction in activity of a specific thyroxine deiodinase, a selenocysteine-containing enzyme, and abnormal thyroid hormone metabolism. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants.	SECISBP2
