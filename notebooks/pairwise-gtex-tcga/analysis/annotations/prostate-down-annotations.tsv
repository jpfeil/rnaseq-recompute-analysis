Beta subunits are important regulators of alpha subunits, as well as of certain signal transduction receptors and effectors. A single-nucleotide polymorphism (C825T) in this gene is associated with essential hypertension and obesity. This polymorphism is also associated with the occurrence of the splice variant GNB3-s, which appears to have increased activity. GNB3-s is an example of alternative splicing caused by a nucleotide change outside of the splice donor and acceptor sites. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. Additional alternatively spliced transcript variants of this gene have been described, but their full-length nature is not known.	GNB3

KLF8	11279	96.72214	11279.0	Kruppel like factor 8		This gene encodes a protein which is a member of the Sp/KLF family of transcription factors. Members of this family contain a C-terminal DNA-binding domain with three Kruppel-like zinc fingers. The encoded protein is thought to play an important role in the regulation of epithelial to mesenchymal transition, a process which occurs normally during development but also during metastasis. A pseudogene has been identified on chromosome 16. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.	KLF8

MAP3K12	7786	93.67235	7786.0	mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 12		This gene encodes a member of the serine/threonine protein kinase family. This kinase contains a leucine-zipper domain and is predominately expressed in neuronal cells. The phosphorylation state of this kinase in synaptic terminals was shown to be regulated by membrane depolarization via calcineurin. This kinase forms heterodimers with leucine zipper containing transcription factors, such as cAMP responsive element binding protein (CREB) and MYC, and thus may play a regulatory role in PKA or retinoic acid induced neuronal differentiation. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different proteins have been described.	MAP3K12
NKTR	4820	90.25634	4820.0	natural killer cell triggering receptor		This gene encodes a membrane-anchored protein with a hydrophobic amino terminal domain and a cyclophilin-like PPIase domain. It is present on the surface of natural killer cells and facilitates their binding to targets. Its expression is regulated by IL2 activation of the cells.	NKTR
MBD1	4152	95.62866	4152.0	methyl-CpG binding domain protein 1		The protein encoded by this gene is a member of a family of nuclear proteins related by the presence of a methyl-CpG binding domain (MBD). These proteins are capable of binding specifically to methylated DNA, and some members can also repress transcription from methylated gene promoters. This protein contains multiple domains: MBD at the N-terminus that functions both in binding to methylated DNA and in protein interactions; several CXXC-type zinc finger domains that mediate binding to non-methylated CpG dinucleotides; transcriptional repression domain (TRD) at the C-terminus that is involved in transcription repression and in protein interactions. Numerous alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been noted for this gene.	MBD1
ZNF655	79027	102.38475	79027.0	zinc finger protein 655		This gene encodes a zinc finger protein. The zinc finger proteins are involved in DNA binding and protein-protein interactions. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been found for this gene.	ZNF655
SEC61A2	55176	93.46188	55176.0	Sec61 translocon alpha 2 subunit		The protein encoded by this gene has similarity to a mouse protein which suggests a role in the insertion of secretory and membrane polypeptides into the endoplasmic reticulum. It may also be required for the assembly of membrane and secretory proteins. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.	SEC61A2
