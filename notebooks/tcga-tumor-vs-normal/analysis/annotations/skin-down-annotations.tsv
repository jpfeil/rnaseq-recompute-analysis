RBMY1B	378948	116.87016	378948	RNA binding motif protein, Y-linked, family 1, member B	This gene encodes a protein containing an RNA-binding motif in the N-terminus and four SRGY (serine, arginine, glycine, tyrosine) boxes in the C-terminus. This protein likely functions as a splicing factor during spermatogenesis. Multiple closely related paralogs of this gene are found in a gene cluster in the AZFb azoospermia factor region of chromosome Y. Most of these related copies are thought to be pseudogenes, though several likely encode functional proteins.	RBMY1B
CR2	1380	97.96239	1380	complement C3d receptor 2	This gene encodes a membrane protein, which functions as a receptor for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) binding on B and T lymphocytes. Genetic variations in this gene are associated with susceptibility to systemic lupus erythematosus type 9 (SLEB9). Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.	CR2
RBMY1F	159163	116.87016	159163	RNA binding motif protein, Y-linked, family 1, member F	This gene encodes a protein containing an RNA-binding motif in the N-terminus and four SRGY (serine, arginine, glycine, tyrosine) boxes in the C-terminus. Multiple copies of this gene are found in the AZFb azoospermia factor region of chromosome Y and the encoded protein is thought to be involved in spermatogenesis. Most copies of this locus are pseudogenes, although six highly similar copies have full-length ORFs and are considered functional. Four functional copies of this gene are found within inverted repeat IR2; two functional copies of this gene are found in palindrome P3, along with two copies of PTPN13-like, Y-linked.	RBMY1F
CST2	1470	113.74886	1470	cystatin SA	The cystatin superfamily encompasses proteins that contain multiple cystatin-like sequences. Some of the members are active cysteine protease inhibitors, while others have lost or perhaps never acquired this inhibitory activity. There are three inhibitory families in the superfamily, including the type 1 cystatins (stefins), type 2 cystatins and the kininogens. The type 2 cystatin proteins are a class of cysteine proteinase inhibitors found in a variety of human fluids and secretions, where they appear to provide protective functions. The cystatin locus on chromosome 20 contains the majority of the type 2 cystatin genes and pseudogenes. This gene is located in the cystatin locus and encodes a secreted thiol protease inhibitor found at high levels in saliva, tears and seminal plasma.	CST2
RBMY1A1	5940	116.87016	5940	RNA binding motif protein, Y-linked, family 1, member A1	This gene encodes a protein containing an RNA-binding motif in the N-terminus and four SRGY (serine, arginine, glycine, tyrosine) boxes in the C-terminus. This protein is thought to function as a splicing regulator during spermatogenesis. Multiple closely related paralogs of this gene are found in a gene cluster in the AZFb azoospermia factor region of chromosome Y. Most of these related copies are thought to be pseudogenes, though several likely encode functional proteins.	RBMY1A1
