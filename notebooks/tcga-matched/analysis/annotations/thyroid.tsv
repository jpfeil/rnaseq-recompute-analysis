DPP10	57628	95.37884	57628.0	dipeptidyl peptidase like 10		This gene encodes a single-pass type II membrane protein that is a member of the S9B family in clan SC of the serine proteases. This protein has no detectable protease activity, most likely due to the absence of the conserved serine residue normally present in the catalytic domain of serine proteases. However, it does bind specific voltage-gated potassium channels and alters their expression and biophysical properties. Mutations in this gene have been associated with asthma. Alternate transcriptional splice variants, encoding different isoforms, have been characterized.	DPP10
IL32	9235	101.66863	9235.0	interleukin 32		This gene encodes a member of the cytokine family. The protein contains a tyrosine sulfation site, 3 potential N-myristoylation sites, multiple putative phosphorylation sites, and an RGD cell-attachment sequence. Expression of this protein is increased after the activation of T-cells by mitogens or the activation of NK cells by IL-2. This protein induces the production of TNFalpha from macrophage cells. Alternate transcriptional splice variants, encoding different isoforms, have been characterized.	IL32
CALB2	794	94.56738	794.0	calbindin 2		This gene encodes an intracellular calcium-binding protein belonging to the troponin C superfamily. Members of this protein family have six EF-hand domains which bind calcium. This protein plays a role in diverse cellular functions, including message targeting and intracellular calcium buffering. It also functions as a modulator of neuronal excitability, and is a diagnostic marker for some human diseases, including Hirschsprung disease and some cancers. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.	CALB2
EIF4EBP2	1979	95.67043	1979.0	eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E binding protein 2		This gene encodes a member of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E binding protein family. The gene products of this family bind eIF4E and inhibit translation initiation. However, insulin and other growth factors can release this inhibition via a phosphorylation-dependent disruption of their binding to eIF4E. Regulation of protein production through these gene products have been implicated in cell proliferation, cell differentiation and viral infection.	EIF4EBP2
LPIN1	23175	93.16212	23175.0	lipin 1		This gene encodes a magnesium-ion-dependent phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase enzyme that catalyzes the penultimate step in triglyceride synthesis including the dephosphorylation of phosphatidic acid to yield diacylglycerol. Expression of this gene is required for adipocyte differentiation and it also functions as a nuclear transcriptional coactivator with some peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors to modulate expression of other genes involved in lipid metabolism. Mutations in this gene are associated with metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, and autosomal recessive acute recurrent myoglobinuria (ARARM). This gene is also a candidate for several human lipodystrophy syndromes. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms. Additional splice variants have been described but their full-length structures have not been determined.	LPIN1
ABLIM1	3983	96.95384	3983.0	actin binding LIM protein 1		This gene encodes a cytoskeletal LIM protein that binds to actin filaments via a domain that is homologous to erythrocyte dematin. LIM domains, found in over 60 proteins, play key roles in the regulation of developmental pathways. LIM domains also function as protein-binding interfaces, mediating specific protein-protein interactions. The protein encoded by this gene could mediate such interactions between actin filaments and cytoplasmic targets. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been identified.	ABLIM1
WDR12	55759	94.30728	55759.0	WD repeat domain 12		This gene encodes a member of the WD repeat protein family. WD repeats are minimally conserved regions of approximately 40 amino acids typically bracketed by gly-his and trp-asp (GH-WD), which may facilitate formation of heterotrimeric or multiprotein complexes. Members of this family are involved in a variety of cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, signal transduction, apoptosis, and gene regulation. This protein is highly similar to the mouse WD repeat domain 12 protein at the amino acid level. The protein encoded by this gene is a component of a nucleolar protein complex that affects maturation of the large ribosomal subunit.	WDR12
AGBL5	60509	96.60782	60509.0	ATP/GTP binding protein like 5		This gene encodes a metallocarboxypeptidase involved in protein deglutamylation and a member of the peptidase M14 family of proteins. The encoded protein has been described as a 'dual-functional' deglutamylase that can remove glutamate residues from both carboxyl termini and side chains of protein substrates. This deglutamylase activity may be important in antiviral immunity. Mutations in this gene are associated with retinitis pigmentosa.	AGBL5

NPTX1	4884	95.68414	4884.0	neuronal pentraxin 1		NPTX1 is a member of the neuronal pentraxin gene family. Neuronal pentraxin 1 is similar to the rat NP1 gene which encodes a binding protein for the snake venom toxin taipoxin. Human NPTX1 mRNA is exclusively localized to the nervous system.	NPTX1
PTPN4	5775	95.65917	5775.0	protein tyrosine phosphatase, non-receptor type 4		The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) family. PTPs are known to be signaling molecules that regulate a variety of cellular processes including cell growth, differentiation, mitotic cycle, and oncogenic transformation. This protein contains a C-terminal PTP domain and an N-terminal domain homologous to the band 4.1 superfamily of cytoskeletal-associated proteins. This PTP has been shown to interact with glutamate receptor delta 2 and epsilon subunits, and is thought to play a role in signalling downstream of the glutamate receptors through tyrosine dephosphorylation.

B3GAT2	135152	93.82693	135152.0	beta-1,3-glucuronyltransferase 2		The product of this gene is a transmembrane protein belonging to the glucuronyltransferase family, and catalyzes the transfer of a beta-1,3 linked glucuronic acid to a terminal galactose in different glycoproteins or glycolipids containing a Gal-beta-1-4GlcNAc or Gal-beta-1-3GlcNAc residue. The encoded protein is involved in the synthesis of the human natural killer-1 (HNK-1) carbohydrate epitope, a sulfated trisaccharide implicated in cellular migration and adhesion in the nervous system.

SOX18	54345	99.428276	54345.0	SRY-box 18		This gene encodes a member of the SOX (SRY-related HMG-box) family of transcription factors involved in the regulation of embryonic development and in the determination of the cell fate. The encoded protein may act as a transcriptional regulator after forming a protein complex with other proteins. This protein plays a role in hair, blood vessel, and lymphatic vessel development. Mutations in this gene have been associated with recessive and dominant forms of hypotrichosis-lymphedema-telangiectasia.	SOX18
