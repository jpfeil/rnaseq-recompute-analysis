GSTA2	2939	108.448425	2939.0	glutathione S-transferase alpha 2		Cytosolic and membrane-bound forms of glutathione S-transferase are encoded by two distinct supergene families. These enzymes function in the detoxification of electrophilic compounds, including carcinogens, therapeutic drugs, environmental toxins and products of oxidative stress, by conjugation with glutathione. The genes encoding these enzymes are known to be highly polymorphic.

FASLG	356	96.291664	356.0	Fas ligand		This gene is a member of the tumor necrosis factor superfamily. The primary function of the encoded transmembrane protein is the induction of apoptosis triggered by binding to FAS. The FAS/FASLG signaling pathway is essential for immune system regulation, including activation-induced cell death (AICD) of T cells and cytotoxic T lymphocyte induced cell death. It has also been implicated in the progression of several cancers. Defects in this gene may be related to some cases of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been described.	FASLG
MOGAT2	80168	97.331604	80168.0	monoacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 2		The protein encoded by this gene is an enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of diacylglycerol from 2-monoacylglycerol and fatty acyl-CoA. The encoded protein is important in the uptake of dietary fat by the small intestine. This protein forms a complex with diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 2 in the endoplasmic reticulum, and this complex catalyzes the synthesis of triacylglycerol.	MOGAT2

OR13C8	138802	105.82861	138802.0	olfactory receptor family 13 subfamily C member 8		Olfactory receptors interact with odorant molecules in the nose, to initiate a neuronal response that triggers the perception of a smell. The olfactory receptor proteins are members of a large family of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) arising from single coding-exon genes. Olfactory receptors share a 7-transmembrane domain structure with many neurotransmitter and hormone receptors and are responsible for the recognition and G protein-mediated transduction of odorant signals. The olfactory receptor gene family is the largest in the genome. The nomenclature assigned to the olfactory receptor genes and proteins for this organism is independent of other organisms.	OR13C8
UBN1	29855	97.69891	29855.0	ubinuclein 1		Cellular senescence is a hallmark of tumor suppression and tissue aging.

USH2A	7399	94.84047	7399.0	usherin		This gene encodes a protein that contains laminin EGF motifs, a pentaxin domain, and many fibronectin type III motifs. The protein is found in the basement membrane, and may be important in development and homeostasis of the inner ear and retina. Mutations within this gene have been associated with Usher syndrome type IIa and retinitis pigmentosa. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.	USH2A
PFN2	5217	95.65765	5217.0	profilin 2		The protein encoded by this gene is a ubiquitous actin monomer-binding protein belonging to the profilin family. It is thought to regulate actin polymerization in response to extracellular signals. There are two alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms described for this gene.	PFN2
FANCM	57697	95.66559	57697.0	Fanconi anemia complementation group M		The Fanconi anemia complementation group (FANC) currently includes FANCA, FANCB, FANCC, FANCD1 (also called BRCA2), FANCD2, FANCE, FANCF, FANCG, FANCI, FANCJ (also called BRIP1), FANCL, FANCM and FANCN (also called PALB2). The previously defined group FANCH is the same as FANCA. Fanconi anemia is a genetically heterogeneous recessive disorder characterized by cytogenetic instability, hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents, increased chromosomal breakage, and defective DNA repair. The members of the Fanconi anemia complementation group do not share sequence similarity; they are related by their assembly into a common nuclear protein complex. This gene encodes the protein for complementation group M. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.	FANCM
HIST1H2BF	8343	107.04052	8343.0	histone cluster 1 H2B family member f		Histones are basic nuclear proteins that are responsible for the nucleosome structure of the chromosomal fiber in eukaryotes. Two molecules of each of the four core histones (H2A, H2B, H3, and H4) form an octamer, around which approximately 146 bp of DNA is wrapped in repeating units, called nucleosomes. The linker histone, H1, interacts with linker DNA between nucleosomes and functions in the compaction of chromatin into higher order structures. This gene is intronless and encodes a replication-dependent histone that is a member of the histone H2B family. The protein has antibacterial and antifungal antimicrobial activity. Transcripts from this gene lack polyA tails but instead contain a palindromic termination element. This gene is found in the large histone gene cluster on chromosome 6.	HIST1H2BF
