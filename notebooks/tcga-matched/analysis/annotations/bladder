B4GALT2	8704	96.621506	8704.0	beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase 2		This gene is one of seven beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase (beta4GalT) genes. They encode type II membrane-bound glycoproteins that appear to have exclusive specificity for the donor substrate UDP-galactose; all transfer galactose in a beta1,4 linkage to similar acceptor sugars: GlcNAc, Glc, and Xyl. Each beta4GalT has a distinct function in the biosynthesis of different glycoconjugates and saccharide structures. As type II membrane proteins, they have an N-terminal hydrophobic signal sequence that directs the protein to the Golgi apparatus and which then remains uncleaved to function as a transmembrane anchor. By sequence similarity, the beta4GalTs form four groups: beta4GalT1 and beta4GalT2, beta4GalT3 and beta4GalT4, beta4GalT5 and beta4GalT6, and beta4GalT7. The enzyme encoded by this gene synthesizes N-acetyllactosamine in glycolipids and glycoproteins.

FGFRL1	53834	96.62478	53834.0	fibroblast growth factor receptor-like 1		The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) family, where amino acid sequence is highly conserved between members and throughout evolution. FGFR family members differ from one another in their ligand affinities and tissue distribution. A full-length representative protein would consist of an extracellular region, composed of three immunoglobulin-like domains, a single hydrophobic membrane-spanning segment and a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain. The extracellular portion of the protein interacts with fibroblast growth factors, setting in motion a cascade of downstream signals, ultimately influencing mitogenesis and differentiation. A marked difference between this gene product and the other family members is its lack of a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain. The result is a transmembrane receptor that could interact with other family members and potentially inhibit signaling. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding the same isoform have been found for this gene.	FGFRL1

The protein belongs to the L23P family of ribosomal proteins. It is located in the cytoplasm. The protein may be one of the target molecules involved in mediating growth inhibition by interferon. In yeast, the corresponding protein binds to a specific site on the 26S rRNA. This gene is co-transcribed with the U42A, U42B, U101A, and U101B small nucleolar RNA genes, which are located in its third, first, second, and fourth introns, respectively. As is typical for genes encoding ribosomal proteins, there are multiple processed pseudogenes of this gene dispersed through the genome.	RPL23A

SLC24A2	25769	97.32834	25769.0	solute carrier family 24 member 2		This gene encodes a member of the calcium/cation antiporter superfamily of transport proteins. The encoded protein belongs to the SLC24 branch of exchangers, which can mediate the extrusion of one Ca2+ ion and one K+ ion in exchange for four Na+ ions. This family member is a retinal cone/brain exchanger that can mediate a light-induced decrease in free Ca2+ concentration. This protein may also play a neuroprotective role during ischemic brain injury. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.	SLC24A2

AKR1B1	231	98.0885	231.0	aldo-keto reductase family 1 member B		This gene encodes a member of the aldo/keto reductase superfamily, which consists of more than 40 known enzymes and proteins. This member catalyzes the reduction of a number of aldehydes, including the aldehyde form of glucose, and is thereby implicated in the development of diabetic complications by catalyzing the reduction of glucose to sorbitol. Multiple pseudogenes have been identified for this gene. The nomenclature system used by the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee to define human aldo-keto reductase family members is known to differ from that used by the Mouse Genome Informatics database.

TMEM216	51259	98.97698	51259.0	transmembrane protein 216		This locus encodes a transmembrane domain-containing protein. Mutations at this locus have been associated with Meckel-Gruber Syndrome Type 2, and Joubert Syndrome 2, also known as Cerebello-oculorenal Syndrome 2.	TMEM216
ZFP57	346171	99.92845	346171.0	ZFP57 zinc finger protein		The protein encoded by this gene is a zinc finger protein containing a KRAB domain. Studies in mouse suggest that this protein may function as a transcriptional repressor. Mutations in this gene have been associated with transient neonatal diabetes mellitus type 1 (TNDM1).	ZFP57

RRM2	6241	95.39428	6241.0	ribonucleotide reductase regulatory subunit M2		This gene encodes one of two non-identical subunits for ribonucleotide reductase. This reductase catalyzes the formation of deoxyribonucleotides from ribonucleotides. Synthesis of the encoded protein (M2) is regulated in a cell-cycle dependent fashion. Transcription from this gene can initiate from alternative promoters, which results in two isoforms that differ in the lengths of their N-termini. Related pseudogenes have been identified on chromosomes 1 and X.	RRM2
DDHD1	80821	95.3731	80821.0	DDHD domain containing 1		This gene is a member of the intracellular phospholipase A1 gene family. The protein encoded by this gene preferentially hydrolyzes phosphatidic acid. It is a cytosolic protein with some mitochondrial localization, and is thought to be involved in the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics. Overexpression of this gene causes fragmentation of the tubular structures in mitochondria, while depletion of the gene results in mitochondrial tubule elongation. Deletion of this gene in male mice caused fertility defects, resulting from disruption in the organization of the mitochondria during spermiogenesis. In humans, mutations in this gene have been associated with hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP), also known as Strumpell-Lorrain disease, or, familial spastic paraparesis (FSP). This inherited disorder is characterized by progressive weakness and spasticity of the legs. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms.	DDHD1

The proteins of this family are thought to be involved in the formation of filamentous networks in the extracellular matrices of various tissues. This family member is thought to be play a role in reorganizing and regenerating the corneal matrix in granular and lattice type I dystrophies. It may also be involved in wound healing in the dentin-pulp complex. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.	MATN4

FMO2	2327	101.05603	2327.0	flavin containing monooxygenase 2		This gene encodes a flavin-containing monooxygenase family member. It is an NADPH-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the N-oxidation of some primary alkylamines through an N-hydroxylamine intermediate. However, some human populations contain an allele (FMO2*2A) with a premature stop codon, resulting in a protein that is C-terminally-truncated, has no catalytic activity, and is likely degraded rapidly. This gene is found in a cluster with other related family members on chromosome 1. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.	FMO2
