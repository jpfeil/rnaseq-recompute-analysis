GTPBP4	23560	97.602745	23560.0	GTP binding protein 4		GTP-binding proteins are GTPases and function as molecular switches that can flip between two states: active, when GTP is bound, and inactive, when GDP is bound. 'Active' in this context usually means that the molecule acts as a signal to trigger other events in the cell. When an extracellular ligand binds to a G-protein-linked receptor, the receptor changes its conformation and switches on the trimeric G proteins that associate with it by causing them to eject their GDP and replace it with GTP. The switch is turned off when the G protein hydrolyzes its own bound GTP, converting it back to GDP. But before that occurs, the active protein has an opportunity to diffuse away from the receptor and deliver its message for a prolonged period to its downstream target.	GTPBP4

Immunocytochemistry of HT-H cells showed that bystin colocalizes with trophinin, tastin, and the cytokeratins, suggesting that these molecules form a complex in trophectoderm cells at the time of implantation. Using immunohistochemistry it was determined that trophinin and bystin are found in the placenta from the sixth week of pregnancy. Both proteins were localized in the cytoplasm of the syncytiotrophoblast in the chorionic villi and in endometrial decidual cells at the uteroplacental interface.

LAMC2	3918	96.33968	3918.0	laminin subunit gamma 2		Laminins, a family of extracellular matrix glycoproteins, are the major noncollagenous constituent of basement membranes. They have been implicated in a wide variety of biological processes including cell adhesion, differentiation, migration, signaling, neurite outgrowth and metastasis. Laminins, composed of 3 non identical chains: laminin alpha, beta and gamma (formerly A, B1, and B2, respectively), have a cruciform structure consisting of 3 short arms, each formed by a different chain, and a long arm composed of all 3 chains. Each laminin chain is a multidomain protein encoded by a distinct gene. Several isoforms of each chain have been described. Different alpha, beta and gamma chain isomers combine to give rise to different heterotrimeric laminin isoforms which are designated by Arabic numerals in the order of their discovery, i.e. alpha1beta1gamma1 heterotrimer is laminin 1. The biological functions of the different chains and trimer molecules are largely unknown, but some of the chains have been shown to differ with respect to their tissue distribution, presumably reflecting diverse functions in vivo. This gene encodes the gamma chain isoform laminin, gamma 2. The gamma 2 chain, formerly thought to be a truncated version of beta chain (B2t), is highly homologous to the gamma 1 chain; however, it lacks domain VI, and domains V, IV and III are shorter. It is expressed in several fetal tissues but differently from gamma 1, and is specifically localized to epithelial cells in skin, lung and kidney. The gamma 2 chain together with alpha 3 and beta 3 chains constitute laminin 5 (earlier known as kalinin), which is an integral part of the anchoring filaments that connect epithelial cells to the underlying basement membrane. The epithelium-specific expression of the gamma 2 chain implied its role as an epithelium attachment molecule, and mutations in this gene have been associated with junctional epidermolysis bullosa, a skin disease characterized by blisters due to disruption of the epidermal-dermal junction. Two transcript variants resulting from alternative splicing of the 3' terminal exon, and encoding different isoforms of gamma 2 chain, have been described. The two variants are differentially expressed in embryonic tissues, however, the biological significance of the two forms is not known. Transcript variants utilizing alternative polyA_signal have also been noted in literature.	LAMC2

They are implicated in a number of cellular processes involving alteration of RNA secondary structure such as translation initiation, nuclear and mitochondrial splicing, and ribosome and spliceosome assembly. Based on their distribution patterns, some members of this family are believed to be involved in embryogenesis, spermatogenesis, and cellular growth and division. This gene encodes a DEAD box protein, and it is activated by Myc protein.	DDX18
PPAN	56342	100.3924	56342.0	peter pan homolog (Drosophila)		The protein encoded by this gene is an evolutionarily conserved protein similar to yeast SSF1 as well as to the gene product of the Drosophila gene peter pan (ppan). SSF1 is known to be involved in the second step of mRNA splicing. Both SSF1 and ppan are essential for cell growth and proliferation. Exogenous expression of this gene was reported to reduce the anchorage-independent growth of some tumor cells. Read-through transcription of this gene with P2RY11/P2Y(11), an adjacent downstream gene that encodes an ATP receptor, has been found. These read-through transcripts are ubiquitously present and up-regulated during granulocyte differentiation.	PPAN
GRM2	2912	97.258255	2912.0	glutamate metabotropic receptor 2		L-glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system and activates both ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors. Glutamatergic neurotransmission is involved in most aspects of normal brain function and can be perturbed in many neuropathologic conditions. The metabotropic glutamate receptors are a family of G protein-coupled receptors, that have been divided into 3 groups on the basis of sequence homology, putative signal transduction mechanisms, and pharmacologic properties. Group I includes GRM1 and GRM5 and these receptors have been shown to activate phospholipase C. Group II includes GRM2 and GRM3 while Group III includes GRM4, GRM6, GRM7 and GRM8. Group II and III receptors are linked to the inhibition of the cyclic AMP cascade but differ in their agonist selectivities. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.	GRM2
RAD51	5888	95.78958	5888.0	RAD51 recombinase		The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the RAD51 protein family. RAD51 family members are highly similar to bacterial RecA and Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rad51, and are known to be involved in the homologous recombination and repair of DNA. This protein can interact with the ssDNA-binding protein RPA and RAD52, and it is thought to play roles in homologous pairing and strand transfer of DNA. This protein is also found to interact with BRCA1 and BRCA2, which may be important for the cellular response to DNA damage. BRCA2 is shown to regulate both the intracellular localization and DNA-binding ability of this protein. Loss of these controls following BRCA2 inactivation may be a key event leading to genomic instability and tumorigenesis. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.	RAD51
ARHGAP11A	9824	96.05783	9824.0	Rho GTPase activating protein 11A		This gene encodes a member of the Rho GTPase activating protein family. In response to DNA damage, the encoded protein interacts with the p53 tumor suppressor protein and stimulates its tetramerization, which results in cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. A chromosomal deletion that includes this gene is one cause of Prader-Willi syndrome, and an intronic variant of this gene may be associated with sleep duration in children. This gene is highly expressed in colon cancers and in a human basal-like breast cancer cell line.	ARHGAP11A

GAL3ST2	64090	96.632164	64090.0	galactose-3-O-sulfotransferase 2		This gene encodes a member of the galactose-3-O-sulfotransferase protein family. The product of this gene catalyzes sulfonation by transferring a sulfate group to the hydroxyl at C-3 of nonreducing beta-galactosyl residues, and it can act on both type 1 and type 2 (Galbeta 1-3/1-4GlcNAc-R) oligosaccharides with similar efficiencies, and on core 1 glycans. This enzyme has been implicated in tumor metastasis processes. This gene is different from the GAL3ST3 gene located on chromosome 11, which has also been referred to as GAL3ST2 and encodes a related enzyme with distinct tissue distribution and substrate specificities, compared to galactose-3-O-sulfotransferase 2.	GAL3ST2
HOXC6	3223	94.12649	3223.0	homeobox C6		This gene belongs to the homeobox family, members of which encode a highly conserved family of transcription factors that play an important role in morphogenesis in all multicellular organisms. Mammals possess four similar homeobox gene clusters, HOXA, HOXB, HOXC and HOXD, which are located on different chromosomes and consist of 9 to 11 genes arranged in tandem. This gene, HOXC6, is one of several HOXC genes located in a cluster on chromosome 12. Three genes, HOXC5, HOXC4 and HOXC6, share a 5' non-coding exon. Transcripts may include the shared exon spliced to the gene-specific exons, or they may include only the gene-specific exons. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been identified for HOXC6. Transcript variant two includes the shared exon, and transcript variant one includes only gene-specific exons.	HOXC6
COL5A2	1290	95.03931	1290.0	collagen type V alpha 2 chain		This gene encodes an alpha chain for one of the low abundance fibrillar collagens. Fibrillar collagen molecules are trimers that can be composed of one or more types of alpha chains. Type V collagen is found in tissues containing type I collagen and appears to regulate the assembly of heterotypic fibers composed of both type I and type V collagen. This gene product is closely related to type XI collagen and it is possible that the collagen chains of types V and XI constitute a single collagen type with tissue-specific chain combinations. Mutations in this gene are associated with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, types I and II.	COL5A2

FANCA	2175	96.05707	2175.0	Fanconi anemia complementation group A		The Fanconi anemia complementation group (FANC) currently includes FANCA, FANCB, FANCC, FANCD1 (also called BRCA2), FANCD2, FANCE, FANCF, FANCG, FANCI, FANCJ (also called BRIP1), FANCL, FANCM and FANCN (also called PALB2). The previously defined group FANCH is the same as FANCA. Fanconi anemia is a genetically heterogeneous recessive disorder characterized by cytogenetic instability, hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents, increased chromosomal breakage, and defective DNA repair. The members of the Fanconi anemia complementation group do not share sequence similarity; they are related by their assembly into a common nuclear protein complex. This gene encodes the protein for complementation group A. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms. Mutations in this gene are the most common cause of Fanconi anemia.	FANCA
DCLRE1B	64858	95.04338	64858.0	DNA cross-link repair 1B		DNA interstrand cross-links prevent strand separation, thereby physically blocking transcription, replication, and segregation of DNA. DCLRE1B is one of several evolutionarily conserved genes involved in repair of interstrand cross-links (Dronkert et al., 2000 [PubMed 10848582]).	DCLRE1B
SET	6418	96.63792	6418.0	SET nuclear proto-oncogene		The protein encoded by this gene inhibits acetylation of nucleosomes, especially histone H4, by histone acetylases (HAT). This inhibition is most likely accomplished by masking histone lysines from being acetylated, and the consequence is to silence HAT-dependent transcription. The encoded protein is part of a complex localized to the endoplasmic reticulum but is found in the nucleus and inhibits apoptosis following attack by cytotoxic T lymphocytes. This protein can also enhance DNA replication of the adenovirus genome. Several transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.	SET

BID	637	94.348885	637.0	BH3 interacting domain death agonist		This gene encodes a death agonist that heterodimerizes with either agonist BAX or antagonist BCL2. The encoded protein is a member of the BCL-2 family of cell death regulators. It is a mediator of mitochondrial damage induced by caspase-8 (CASP8); CASP8 cleaves this encoded protein, and the COOH-terminal part translocates to mitochondria where it triggers cytochrome c release. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found, but the full-length nature of some variants has not been defined.	BID
PRPF4	9128	97.2562	9128.0	pre-mRNA processing factor 4		The protein encoded by this gene is part of a heteromeric complex that binds U4, U5, and U6 small nuclear RNAs and is involved in pre-mRNA splicing.

UHRF1	29128	95.274765	29128.0	ubiquitin like with PHD and ring finger domains 1		This gene encodes a member of a subfamily of RING-finger type E3 ubiquitin ligases. The protein binds to specific DNA sequences, and recruits a histone deacetylase to regulate gene expression. Its expression peaks at late G1 phase and continues during G2 and M phases of the cell cycle. It plays a major role in the G1/S transition by regulating topoisomerase IIalpha and retinoblastoma gene expression, and functions in the p53-dependent DNA damage checkpoint. It is regarded as a hub protein for the integration of epigenetic information. This gene is up-regulated in various cancers, and it is therefore considered to be a therapeutic target. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. A related pseudogene exists on chromosome 12.	UHRF1
TNFRSF4	7293	94.348885	7293.0	TNF receptor superfamily member 4		The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the TNF-receptor superfamily. This receptor has been shown to activate NF-kappaB through its interaction with adaptor proteins TRAF2 and TRAF5. Knockout studies in mice suggested that this receptor promotes the expression of apoptosis inhibitors BCL2 and BCL2lL1/BCL2-XL, and thus suppresses apoptosis. The knockout studies also suggested the roles of this receptor in CD4+ T cell response, as well as in T cell-dependent B cell proliferation and differentiation.	TNFRSF4

NFKB2	4791	96.33723	4791.0	nuclear factor kappa B subunit 2		This gene encodes a subunit of the transcription factor complex nuclear factor-kappa-B (NFkB). The NFkB complex is expressed in numerous cell types and functions as a central activator of genes involved in inflammation and immune function. The protein encoded by this gene can function as both a transcriptional activator or repressor depending on its dimerization partner. The p100 full-length protein is co-translationally processed into a p52 active form. Chromosomal rearrangements and translocations of this locus have been observed in B cell lymphomas, some of which may result in the formation of fusion proteins. There is a pseudogene for this gene on chromosome 18. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.	NFKB2
RFC4	5984	94.33422	5984.0	replication factor C subunit 4		The elongation of primed DNA templates by DNA polymerase delta and DNA polymerase epsilon requires the accessory proteins proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and replication factor C (RFC). RFC, also named activator 1, is a protein complex consisting of five distinct subunits of 140, 40, 38, 37, and 36 kD. This gene encodes the 37 kD subunit. This subunit forms a core complex with the 36 and 40 kDa subunits. The core complex possesses DNA-dependent ATPase activity, which was found to be stimulated by PCNA in an in vitro system. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding the same protein have been reported.	RFC4
COMP	1311	94.55349	1311.0	cartilage oligomeric matrix protein		The protein encoded by this gene is a noncollagenous extracellular matrix (ECM) protein. It consists of five identical glycoprotein subunits, each with EGF-like and calcium-binding (thrombospondin-like) domains. Oligomerization results from formation of a five-stranded coiled coil and disulfides. Binding to other ECM proteins such as collagen appears to depend on divalent cations. Contraction or expansion of a 5 aa aspartate repeat and other mutations can cause pseudochondroplasia (PSACH) and multiple epiphyseal dysplasia (MED).	COMP

MAD2L1 is related to the MAD2L2 gene located on chromosome 1.  A MAD2 pseudogene has been mapped to chromosome 14.	MAD2L1
BAMBI	25805	94.58057	25805.0	BMP and activin membrane bound inhibitor		This gene encodes a transmembrane glycoprotein related to the type I receptors of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) family, whose members play important roles in signal transduction in many developmental and pathological processes. The encoded protein however is a pseudoreceptor, lacking an intracellular serine/threonine kinase domain required for signaling. Similar proteins in frog, mouse and zebrafish function as negative regulators of TGF-beta, which has led to the suggestion that the encoded protein may function to limit the signaling range of the TGF-beta family during early embryogenesis.	BAMBI
FGFR4	2264	94.113846	2264.0	fibroblast growth factor receptor 4		The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the fibroblast growth factor receptor family, where amino acid sequence is highly conserved between members and throughout evolution. FGFR family members differ from one another in their ligand affinities and tissue distribution. A full-length representative protein would consist of an extracellular region, composed of three immunoglobulin-like domains, a single hydrophobic membrane-spanning segment and a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain. The extracellular portion of the protein interacts with fibroblast growth factors, setting in motion a cascade of downstream signals, ultimately influencing mitogenesis and differentiation. The genomic organization of this gene, compared to members 1-3, encompasses 18 exons rather than 19 or 20. Although alternative splicing has been observed, there is no evidence that the C-terminal half of the IgIII domain of this protein varies between three alternate forms, as indicated for members 1-3. This particular family member preferentially binds acidic fibroblast growth factor and, although its specific function is unknown, it is overexpressed in gynecological tumor samples, suggesting a role in breast and ovarian tumorigenesis.

The encoded protein is a secreted growth factor that signals through the G-protein coupled receptor, CXC receptor 2. This protein plays a role in inflammation and as a chemoattractant for neutrophils. Aberrant expression of this protein is associated with the growth and progression of certain tumors. A naturally occurring processed form of this protein has increased chemotactic activity. Alternate splicing results in coding and non-coding variants of this gene. A pseudogene of this gene is found on chromosome 4.	CXCL1

CCNE1	898	93.92523	898.0	cyclin E1		The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the highly conserved cyclin family, whose members are characterized by a dramatic periodicity in protein abundance through the cell cycle. Cyclins function as regulators of CDK kinases. Different cyclins exhibit distinct expression and degradation patterns which contribute to the temporal coordination of each mitotic event. This cyclin forms a complex with and functions as a regulatory subunit of CDK2, whose activity is required for cell cycle G1/S transition. This protein accumulates at the G1-S phase boundary and is degraded as cells progress through S phase. Overexpression of this gene has been observed in many tumors, which results in chromosome instability, and thus may contribute to tumorigenesis. This protein was found to associate with, and be involved in, the phosphorylation of NPAT protein (nuclear protein mapped to the ATM locus), which participates in cell-cycle regulated histone gene expression and plays a critical role in promoting cell-cycle progression in the absence of pRB.

The augmin complex was first identified in Drosophila, and its name comes from the Latin verb 'augmentare,' meaning 'to increase.' The augmin complex is a microtubule-binding complex involved in microtubule generation within the mitotic spindle and is vital to mitotic spindle assembly (Goshima et al., 2008 [PubMed 18443220]; Uehara et al., 2009 [PubMed 19369198]).

The encoded protein interacts with BOP1 and WDR12 to form the PeBoW complex, which plays a critical role in cell proliferation via pre-rRNA processing and 60S ribosomal subunit maturation. Expression of this gene may play an important role in breast cancer proliferation and tumorigenicity. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding multiple isoforms have been observed for this gene. Pseudogenes of this gene are located on the long arm of chromosome 4 and the short arm of chromosome 9.	PES1

EHMT2	10919	95.26825	10919.0	euchromatic histone lysine methyltransferase 2		This gene encodes a methyltransferase that methylates lysine residues of histone H3. Methylation of H3 at lysine 9 by this protein results in recruitment of additional epigenetic regulators and repression of transcription. This gene was initially thought to be two different genes, NG36 and G9a, adjacent to each other in the HLA locus. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.	EHMT2
UBE2C	11065	94.550674	11065.0	ubiquitin conjugating enzyme E2 C		The modification of proteins with ubiquitin is an important cellular mechanism for targeting abnormal or short-lived proteins for degradation. Ubiquitination involves at least three classes of enzymes: ubiquitin-activating enzymes, ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, and ubiquitin-protein ligases. This gene encodes a member of the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme family. The encoded protein is required for the destruction of mitotic cyclins and for cell cycle progression, and may be involved in cancer progression. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. Pseudogenes of this gene have been defined on chromosomes 4, 14, 15, 18, and 19.	UBE2C
HSD3B7	80270	96.63587	80270.0	hydroxy-delta-5-steroid dehydrogenase, 3 beta- and steroid delta-isomerase 7		This gene encodes an enzyme which is involved in the initial stages of the synthesis of bile acids from cholesterol and a member of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase superfamily. The encoded protein is a membrane-associated endoplasmic reticulum protein which is active against 7-alpha hydrosylated sterol substrates.

MCM6	4175	94.788185	4175.0	minichromosome maintenance complex component 6		The protein encoded by this gene is one of the highly conserved mini-chromosome maintenance proteins (MCM) that are essential for the initiation of eukaryotic genome replication. The hexameric protein complex formed by the MCM proteins is a key component of the pre-replication complex (pre_RC) and may be involved in the formation of replication forks and in the recruitment of other DNA replication related proteins. The MCM complex consisting of this protein and MCM2, 4 and 7 proteins possesses DNA helicase activity, and may act as a DNA unwinding enzyme. The phosphorylation of the complex by CDC2 kinase reduces the helicase activity, suggesting a role in the regulation of DNA replication. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in the intron regions of this gene are associated with differential transcriptional activation of the promoter of the neighboring lactase gene and, thereby, influence lactose intolerance in early adulthood.	MCM6
CYP19A1	1588	106.80532	1588.0	cytochrome P450 family 19 subfamily A member 1		This gene encodes a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily of enzymes. The cytochrome P450 proteins are monooxygenases which catalyze many reactions involved in drug metabolism and synthesis of cholesterol, steroids and other lipids. This protein localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum and catalyzes the last steps of estrogen biosynthesis. Mutations in this gene can result in either increased or decreased aromatase activity; the associated phenotypes suggest that estrogen functions both as a sex steroid hormone and in growth or differentiation. Alternative promoter use and alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants that have different tissue specificities.	CYP19A1

The encoded protein was originally identified as an important component of glomerular podocytes. Podocytes are highly differentiated epithelial cells with interdigitating foot processes covering the outer aspect of the glomerular basement membrane. Other biological activities of the encoded protein include: binding in a membrane protein complex with Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor to intracellular cytoskeletal elements, playing a role in hematopoetic cell differentiation, and being expressed in vascular endothelium cells and binding to L-selectin.	PODXL
CBFB	865	95.27272	865.0	core-binding factor beta subunit		The protein encoded by this gene is the beta subunit of a heterodimeric core-binding transcription factor belonging to the PEBP2/CBF transcription factor family which master-regulates a host of genes specific to hematopoiesis (e.g., RUNX1) and osteogenesis (e.g., RUNX2). The beta subunit is a non-DNA binding regulatory subunit; it allosterically enhances DNA binding by alpha subunit as the complex binds to the core site of various enhancers and promoters, including murine leukemia virus, polyomavirus enhancer, T-cell receptor enhancers and GM-CSF promoters. Alternative splicing generates two mRNA variants, each encoding a distinct carboxyl terminus. In some cases, a pericentric inversion of chromosome 16 [inv(16)(p13q22)] produces a chimeric transcript consisting of the N terminus of core-binding factor beta in a fusion with the C-terminal portion of the smooth muscle myosin heavy chain 11. This chromosomal rearrangement is associated with acute myeloid leukemia of the M4Eo subtype. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.	CBFB

Proteins in this family are involved in the breakdown of extracellular matrix in normal physiological processes, such as embryonic development, reproduction, and tissue remodeling, as well as in disease processes, such as arthritis and metastasis. The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed to generate the mature protease. This secreted protease breaks down proteoglycans, fibronectin, elastin and casein and differs from most MMP family members in that it lacks a conserved C-terminal hemopexin domain. The enzyme is involved in wound healing, and studies in mice suggest that it regulates the activity of defensins in intestinal mucosa. The gene is part of a cluster of MMP genes on chromosome 11. This gene exhibits elevated expression levels in multiple human cancers.	MMP7

RBL1	5933	93.31021	5933.0	RB transcriptional corepressor like 1		The protein encoded by this gene is similar in sequence and possibly function to the product of the retinoblastoma 1 (RB1) gene. The RB1 gene product is a tumor suppressor protein that appears to be involved in cell cycle regulation, as it is phosphorylated in the S to M phase transition and is dephosphorylated in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Both the RB1 protein and the product of this gene can form a complex with adenovirus E1A protein and SV40 large T-antigen, with the SV40 large T-antigen binding only to the unphosphorylated form of each protein. In addition, both proteins can inhibit the transcription of cell cycle genes containing E2F binding sites in their promoters. Due to the sequence and biochemical similarities with the RB1 protein, it is thought that the protein encoded by this gene may also be a tumor suppressor. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.	RBL1

Most MMP's are secreted as inactive proproteins which are activated when cleaved by extracellular proteinases. However, the protein encoded by this gene is a member of the membrane-type MMP (MT-MMP) subfamily; each member of this subfamily contains a potential transmembrane domain suggesting that these proteins are expressed at the cell surface rather than secreted. This protein activates MMP2 protein, and this activity may be involved in tumor invasion.	MMP14

PKC family members phosphorylate a wide variety of protein targets and are known to be involved in diverse cellular signaling pathways. PKC also serve as major receptors for phorbol esters, a class of tumor promoters. Each member of the PKC family has a specific expression profile and is believed to play distinct roles in cells. The protein encoded by this gene is one of the PKC family members. This protein kinase is expressed solely in the brain and spinal cord and its localization is restricted to neurons.

TERT	7015	93.51022	7015.0	telomerase reverse transcriptase		Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein polymerase that maintains telomere ends by addition of the telomere repeat TTAGGG. The enzyme consists of a protein component with reverse transcriptase activity, encoded by this gene, and an RNA component which serves as a template for the telomere repeat. Telomerase expression plays a role in cellular senescence, as it is normally repressed in postnatal somatic cells resulting in progressive shortening of telomeres. Deregulation of telomerase expression in somatic cells may be involved in oncogenesis. Studies in mouse suggest that telomerase also participates in chromosomal repair, since de novo synthesis of telomere repeats may occur at double-stranded breaks. Alternatively spliced variants encoding different isoforms of telomerase reverse transcriptase have been identified; the full-length sequence of some variants has not been determined. Alternative splicing at this locus is thought to be one mechanism of regulation of telomerase activity.	TERT

TAF4	6874	96.95654	6874.0	TATA-box binding protein associated factor 4		Initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase II requires the activities of more than 70 polypeptides. The protein that coordinates these activities is transcription factor IID (TFIID), which binds to the core promoter to position the polymerase properly, serves as the scaffold for assembly of the remainder of the transcription complex, and acts as a channel for regulatory signals. TFIID is composed of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and a group of evolutionarily conserved proteins known as TBP-associated factors or TAFs. TAFs may participate in basal transcription, serve as coactivators, function in promoter recognition or modify general transcription factors (GTFs) to facilitate complex assembly and transcription initiation. This gene encodes one of the larger subunits of TFIID that has been shown to potentiate transcriptional activation by retinoic acid, thyroid hormone and vitamin D3 receptors. In addition, this subunit interacts with the transcription factor CREB, which has a glutamine-rich activation domain, and binds to other proteins containing glutamine-rich regions. Aberrant binding to this subunit by proteins with expanded polyglutamine regions has been suggested as one of the pathogenetic mechanisms underlying a group of neurodegenerative disorders referred to as polyglutamine diseases.	TAF4
MC1R	4157	96.96357	4157.0	melanocortin 1 receptor		This intronless gene encodes the receptor protein for melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH). The encoded protein, a seven pass transmembrane G protein coupled receptor, controls melanogenesis. Two types of melanin exist: red pheomelanin and black eumelanin. Gene mutations that lead to a loss in function are associated with increased pheomelanin production, which leads to lighter skin and hair color. Eumelanin is photoprotective but pheomelanin may contribute to UV-induced skin damage by generating free radicals upon UV radiation. Binding of MSH to its receptor activates the receptor and stimulates eumelanin synthesis. This receptor is a major determining factor in sun sensitivity and is a genetic risk factor for melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer. Over 30 variant alleles have been identified which correlate with skin and hair color, providing evidence that this gene is an important component in determining normal human pigment variation.	MC1R

FXYD5	53827	101.42896	53827.0	FXYD domain containing ion transport regulator 5		This gene encodes a member of a family of small membrane proteins that share a 35-amino acid signature sequence domain, beginning with the sequence PFXYD and containing 7 invariant and 6 highly conserved amino acids. The approved human gene nomenclature for the family is FXYD-domain containing ion transport regulator. Mouse FXYD5 has been termed RIC (Related to Ion Channel). FXYD2, also known as the gamma subunit of the Na,K-ATPase, regulates the properties of that enzyme. FXYD1 (phospholemman), FXYD2 (gamma), FXYD3 (MAT-8), FXYD4 (CHIF), and FXYD5 (RIC) have been shown to induce channel activity in experimental expression systems. Transmembrane topology has been established for two family members (FXYD1 and FXYD2), with the N-terminus extracellular and the C-terminus on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. This gene product, FXYD5, is a glycoprotein that functions in the up-regulation of chemokine production, and it is involved in the reduction of cell adhesion via its ability to down-regulate E-cadherin. It also promotes metastasis, and has been linked to a variety of cancers. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. [RefSeq curation by Kathleen J.

PTRH2	51651	96.33891	51651.0	peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase 2		The protein encoded by this gene is a mitochondrial protein with two putative domains, an N-terminal mitochondrial localization sequence, and a UPF0099 domain. In vitro assays suggest that this protein possesses peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase activity, to release the peptidyl moiety from tRNA, thereby preventing the accumulation of dissociated peptidyl-tRNA that could reduce the efficiency of translation. This protein also plays a role regulating cell survival and death. It promotes survival as part of an integrin-signaling pathway for cells attached to the extracellular matrix (ECM), but also promotes apoptosis in cells that have lost their attachment to the ECM, a process called anoikos.

The receptors of IL15 and IL2 share two subunits, IL2R beta and IL2R gamma. This forms the basis of many overlapping biological activities of IL15 and IL2. The protein encoded by this gene is structurally related to IL2R alpha, an additional IL2-specific alpha subunit necessary for high affinity IL2 binding. Unlike IL2RA, IL15RA is capable of binding IL15 with high affinity independent of other subunits, which suggests distinct roles between IL15 and IL2. This receptor is reported to enhance cell proliferation and expression of apoptosis inhibitor BCL2L1/BCL2-XL and BCL2.

The constitutive proteins include CENPA (centromere protein A; MIM 117139), CENPB (MIM 117140), CENPC1 (MIM 117141), and CENPD (MIM 117142). The term 'passenger proteins' encompasses a broad collection of proteins that localize to the centromere during specific stages of the cell cycle (Earnshaw and Mackay, 1994 [PubMed 8088460]).

HNRNPU	3192	95.539474	3192.0	heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein U		This gene belongs to the subfamily of ubiquitously expressed heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs). The hnRNPs are RNA binding proteins and they form complexes with heterogeneous nuclear RNA (hnRNA). These proteins are associated with pre-mRNAs in the nucleus and appear to influence pre-mRNA processing and other aspects of mRNA metabolism and transport. While all of the hnRNPs are present in the nucleus, some seem to shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. The hnRNP proteins have distinct nucleic acid binding properties. The protein encoded by this gene contains a RNA binding domain and scaffold-associated region (SAR)-specific bipartite DNA-binding domain. This protein is also thought to be involved in the packaging of hnRNA into large ribonucleoprotein complexes. During apoptosis, this protein is cleaved in a caspase-dependent way. Cleavage occurs at the SALD site, resulting in a loss of DNA-binding activity and a concomitant detachment of this protein from nuclear structural sites. But this cleavage does not affect the function of the encoded protein in RNA metabolism. At least two alternatively spliced transcript variants have been identified for this gene.	HNRNPU

N-myristoyltransferase (NMT; EC 2.3.1.97) catalyzes the transfer of myristate from CoA to proteins. N-myristoylation appears to be irreversible and is required for full expression of the biologic activities of several N-myristoylated proteins, including the alpha subunit of the signal-transducing guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein) GO (GNAO1; MIM 139311) (Duronio et al., 1992 [PubMed 1570339]).

Scaffold attachment factors are a specific subset of nuclear matrix proteins (NMP) that specifically bind to S/MAR. The encoded protein is thought to serve as a molecular base to assemble a 'transcriptosome complex' in the vicinity of actively transcribed genes. It is involved in the regulation of heat shock protein 27 transcription, can act as an estrogen receptor co-repressor and is a candidate for breast tumorigenesis.

PILRA	29992	104.854294	29992.0	paired immunoglobin like type 2 receptor alpha		Cell signaling pathways rely on a dynamic interaction between activating and inhibiting processes. SHP-1-mediated dephosphorylation of protein tyrosine residues is central to the regulation of several cell signaling pathways. Two types of inhibitory receptor superfamily members are immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM)-bearing receptors and their non-ITIM-bearing, activating counterparts. Control of cell signaling via SHP-1 is thought to occur through a balance between PILRalpha-mediated inhibition and PILRbeta-mediated activation. These paired immunoglobulin-like receptor genes are located in a tandem head-to-tail orientation on chromosome 7. This particular gene encodes the ITIM-bearing member of the receptor pair, which functions in the inhibitory role.

HYOU1	10525	95.52683	10525.0	hypoxia up-regulated 1		The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the heat shock protein 70 family. This gene uses alternative transcription start sites. A cis-acting segment found in the 5' UTR is involved in stress-dependent induction, resulting in the accumulation of this protein in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) under hypoxic conditions. The protein encoded by this gene is thought to play an important role in protein folding and secretion in the ER. Since suppression of the protein is associated with accelerated apoptosis, it is also suggested to have an important cytoprotective role in hypoxia-induced cellular perturbation. This protein has been shown to be up-regulated in tumors, especially in breast tumors, and thus it is associated with tumor invasiveness. This gene also has an alternative translation initiation site, resulting in a protein that lacks the N-terminal signal peptide. This signal peptide-lacking protein, which is only 3 amino acids shorter than the mature protein in the ER, is thought to have a housekeeping function in the cytosol. In rat, this protein localizes to both the ER by a carboxy-terminal peptide sequence and to mitochondria by an amino-terminal targeting signal. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.	HYOU1

TBX4	9496	98.66305	9496.0	T-box 4		This gene is a member of a phylogenetically conserved family of genes that share a common DNA-binding domain, the T-box. T-box genes encode transcription factors involved in the regulation of developmental processes. This gene is the human homolog of mouse Tbx4, which is closely linked to Tbx2 on mouse chromosome 11. Similarly this gene, like TBX2, maps to human chromosome 17. Expression studies in mouse and chicken show that Tbx4 is expressed in developing hindlimb, but not in forelimb buds, suggesting a role for this gene in regulating limb development and specification of limb identity.	TBX4
ZP3	7784	98.29312	7784.0	zona pellucida glycoprotein 3		The zona pellucida is an extracellular matrix that surrounds the oocyte and early embryo. It is composed primarily of three or four glycoproteins with various functions during fertilization and preimplantation development. The protein encoded by this gene is a structural component of the zona pellucida and functions in primary binding and induction of the sperm acrosome reaction. The nascent protein contains a N-terminal signal peptide sequence, a conserved ZP domain, a C-terminal consensus furin cleavage site, and a transmembrane domain. It is hypothesized that furin cleavage results in release of the mature protein from the plasma membrane for subsequent incorporation into the zona pellucida matrix. However, the requirement for furin cleavage in this process remains controversial based on mouse studies. A variation in the last exon of this gene has previously served as the basis for an additional ZP3 locus; however, sequence and literature review reveals that there is only one full-length ZP3 locus in the human genome. Another locus encoding a bipartite transcript designated POMZP3 contains a duplication of the last four exons of ZP3, including the above described variation, and maps closely to this gene.	ZP3

PABPN1	8106	99.47959	8106.0	poly(A) binding protein nuclear 1		This gene encodes an abundant nuclear protein that binds with high affinity to nascent poly(A) tails. The protein is required for progressive and efficient polymerization of poly(A) tails at the 3' ends of eukaryotic transcripts and controls the size of the poly(A) tail to about 250 nt. At steady-state, this protein is localized in the nucleus whereas a different poly(A) binding protein is localized in the cytoplasm. This gene contains a GCG trinucleotide repeat at the 5' end of the coding region, and expansion of this repeat from the normal 6 copies to 8-13 copies leads to autosomal dominant oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) disease. Related pseudogenes have been identified on chromosomes 19 and X. Read-through transcription also exists between this gene and the neighboring upstream BCL2-like 2 (BCL2L2) gene.	PABPN1

Post-translational modification of target proteins by PRMTs plays an important regulatory role in many biological processes, whereby PRMTs methylate arginine residues by transferring methyl groups from S-adenosyl-L-methionine to terminal guanidino nitrogen atoms. The encoded protein is a type I PRMT and is responsible for the majority of cellular arginine methylation activity. Increased expression of this gene may play a role in many types of cancer. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding multiple isoforms have been observed for this gene, and a pseudogene of this gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 5.	PRMT1

CLK2	1196	95.791626	1196.0	CDC like kinase 2		This gene encodes a dual specificity protein kinase that phosphorylates serine/threonine and tyrosine-containing substrates. Activity of this protein regulates serine- and arginine-rich (SR) proteins of the spliceosomal complex, thereby influencing alternative transcript splicing. Chromosomal translocations have been characterized between this locus and the PAFAH1B3 (platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase 1b, catalytic subunit 3 (29kDa)) gene on chromosome 19, resulting in the production of a fusion protein. Note that this gene is distinct from the TELO2 gene (GeneID:9894), which shares the CLK2 alias, but encodes a protein that is involved in telomere length regulation. There is a pseudogene for this gene on chromosome 7. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.	CLK2
MRPL15	29088	94.783714	29088.0	mitochondrial ribosomal protein L15		Mammalian mitochondrial ribosomal proteins are encoded by nuclear genes and help in protein synthesis within the mitochondrion. Mitochondrial ribosomes (mitoribosomes) consist of a small 28S subunit and a large 39S subunit. They have an estimated 75% protein to rRNA composition compared to prokaryotic ribosomes, where this ratio is reversed. Another difference between mammalian mitoribosomes and prokaryotic ribosomes is that the latter contain a 5S rRNA. Among different species, the proteins comprising the mitoribosome differ greatly in sequence, and sometimes in biochemical properties, which prevents easy recognition by sequence homology. This gene encodes a 39S subunit protein that belongs to the EcoL15 ribosomal protein family. A pseudogene corresponding to this gene is found on chromosome 15q.	MRPL15

The gene clusters demonstrate an unusual genomic organization similar to that of B-cell and T-cell receptor gene clusters. The beta cluster contains 16 genes and 3 pseudogenes, each encoding 6 extracellular cadherin domains and a cytoplasmic tail that deviates from others in the cadherin superfamily. The extracellular domains interact in a homophilic manner to specify differential cell-cell connections. Unlike the alpha and gamma clusters, the transcripts from these genes are made up of only one large exon, not sharing common 3' exons as expected. These neural cadherin-like cell adhesion proteins are integral plasma membrane proteins.

FADD	8772	94.78448	8772.0	Fas associated via death domain		The protein encoded by this gene is an adaptor molecule that interacts with various cell surface receptors and mediates cell apoptotic signals. Through its C-terminal death domain, this protein can be recruited by TNFRSF6/Fas-receptor, tumor necrosis factor receptor, TNFRSF25, and TNFSF10/TRAIL-receptor, and thus it participates in the death signaling initiated by these receptors. Interaction of this protein with the receptors unmasks the N-terminal effector domain of this protein, which allows it to recruit caspase-8, and thereby activate the cysteine protease cascade. Knockout studies in mice also suggest the importance of this protein in early T cell development.	FADD

It maps to a region on chromosome 1p36 that is frequently deleted in neuroblastoma and other tumors, and thought to contain multiple tumor suppressor genes. The demonstration that this gene is monoallelically expressed (likely from the maternal allele), supports the notion that it is a candidate gene for neuroblastoma. Many transcript variants resulting from alternative splicing and/or use of alternate promoters have been found for this gene, but the biological validity and the full-length nature of some variants have not been determined.

The protein encoded by this gene contains two doublecortin domains, which bind microtubules and regulate microtubule polymerization. The encoded protein is a photoreceptor microtubule-associated protein and is required for correct stacking of outer segment disc. This protein and the RP1L1 protein, another retinal-specific protein, play essential and synergistic roles in affecting photosensitivity and outer segment morphogenesis of rod photoreceptors. Because of its response to in vivo retinal oxygen levels, this protein was initially named ORP1 (oxygen-regulated protein-1). This protein was subsequently designated RP1 (retinitis pigmentosa 1) when it was found that mutations in this gene cause autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa.

DFFB	1677	94.12649	1677.0	DNA fragmentation factor subunit beta		Apoptosis is a cell death process that removes toxic and/or useless cells during mammalian development. The apoptotic process is accompanied by shrinkage and fragmentation of the cells and nuclei and degradation of the chromosomal DNA into nucleosomal units. DNA fragmentation factor (DFF) is a heterodimeric protein of 40-kD (DFFB) and 45-kD (DFFA) subunits. DFFA is the substrate for caspase-3 and triggers DNA fragmentation during apoptosis. DFF becomes activated when DFFA is cleaved by caspase-3. The cleaved fragments of DFFA dissociate from DFFB, the active component of DFF. DFFB has been found to trigger both DNA fragmentation and chromatin condensation during apoptosis. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been found for this gene but the biological validity of some of these variants has not been determined.	DFFB
