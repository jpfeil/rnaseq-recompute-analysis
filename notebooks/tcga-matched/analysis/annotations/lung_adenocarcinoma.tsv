TRHDE	29953	94.320984	29953.0	thyrotropin releasing hormone degrading enzyme		This gene encodes a member of the peptidase M1 family. The encoded protein is an extracellular peptidase that specifically cleaves and inactivates the neuropeptide thyrotropin-releasing hormone.	TRHDE
MST1R	4486	93.152596	4486.0	macrophage stimulating 1 receptor		This gene encodes a cell surface receptor for macrophage-stimulating protein (MSP) with tyrosine kinase activity. The mature form of this protein is a heterodimer of disulfide-linked alpha and beta subunits, generated by proteolytic cleavage of a single-chain precursor. The beta subunit undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation upon stimulation by MSP. This protein is expressed on the ciliated epithelia of the mucociliary transport apparatus of the lung, and together with MSP, thought to be involved in host defense. Alternative splicing generates multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms that may undergo similar proteolytic processing.	MST1R
SERPINB11	89778	32.234985	89778.0	serpin family B member 11 (gene/pseudogene)			SERPINB11
TFDP3	51270	107.0297	51270.0	transcription factor Dp family member 3		This gene encodes a member of the DP family of transcription factors. These factors heterodimerize with E2F proteins to enhance their DNA-binding activity and promote transcription from E2F target genes. This protein functions as a negative regulator and inhibits the DNA binding and transcriptional activities of E2F factors.	TFDP3
COX10	1352	101.048294	1352.0	COX10, heme A:farnesyltransferase cytochrome c oxidase assembly factor		Cytochrome c oxidase (COX), the terminal component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, catalyzes the electron transfer from reduced cytochrome c to oxygen. This component is a heteromeric complex consisting of 3 catalytic subunits encoded by mitochondrial genes and multiple structural subunits encoded by nuclear genes. The mitochondrially-encoded subunits function in electron transfer, and the nuclear-encoded subunits may function in the regulation and assembly of the complex. This nuclear gene encodes heme A:farnesyltransferase, which is not a structural subunit but required for the expression of functional COX and functions in the maturation of the heme A prosthetic group of COX. This protein is predicted to contain 7-9 transmembrane domains localized in the mitochondrial inner membrane. A gene mutation, which results in the substitution of a lysine for an asparagine (N204K), is identified to be responsible for cytochrome c oxidase deficiency. In addition, this gene is disrupted in patients with CMT1A (Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1A) duplication and with HNPP (hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies) deletion.	COX10
CMPK2	129607	95.39428	129607.0	cytidine/uridine monophosphate kinase 2		This gene encodes one of the enzymes in the nucleotide synthesis salvage pathway that may participate in terminal differentiation of monocytic cells. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.	CMPK2
NOTUM	147111	95.97857	147111.0	NOTUM, palmitoleoyl-protein carboxylesterase			NOTUM
ADAMTS16	170690	98.11762	170690.0	ADAM metallopeptidase with thrombospondin type 1 motif 16		This gene encodes a member of the ADAMTS (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs) protein family. ADAMTS family members share several distinct protein modules, including a propeptide region, a metalloproteinase domain, a disintegrin-like domain, and a thrombospondin type 1 (TS) motif. Individual members of this family differ in the number of C-terminal TS motifs, and some have unique C-terminal domains. The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed to generate the mature protein, which may inhibit chondrosarcoma cell proliferation and migration. This gene may regulate blood pressure.	ADAMTS16
MAPKAP1	79109	94.84047	79109.0	mitogen-activated protein kinase associated protein 1		This gene encodes a protein that is highly similar to the yeast SIN1 protein, a stress-activated protein kinase. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been described. Alternate polyadenylation sites as well as alternate 3' UTRs have been identified for transcripts of this gene.	MAPKAP1
RNASEH2A	10535	96.969284	10535.0	ribonuclease H2 subunit A		The protein encoded by this gene is a component of the heterotrimeric type II ribonuclease H enzyme (RNAseH2). RNAseH2 is the major source of ribonuclease H activity in mammalian cells and endonucleolytically cleaves ribonucleotides. It is predicted to remove Okazaki fragment RNA primers during lagging strand DNA synthesis and to excise single ribonucleotides from DNA-DNA duplexes. Mutations in this gene cause Aicardi-Goutieres Syndrome (AGS), a an autosomal recessive neurological disorder characterized by progressive microcephaly and psychomotor retardation, intracranial calcifications, elevated levels of interferon-alpha and white blood cells in the cerebrospinal fluid.	RNASEH2A
FLT3LG	2323	101.66266	2323.0	fms related tyrosine kinase 3 ligand		Dendritic cells (DCs) provide the key link between innate and adaptive immunity by recognizing pathogens and priming pathogen-specific immune responses. FLT3LG controls the development of DCs and is particularly important for plasmacytoid DCs and CD8 (see MIM 186910)-positive classical DCs and their CD103 (ITGAE; MIM 604682)-positive tissue counterparts (summary by Sathaliyawala et al., 2010 [PubMed 20933441]).

TLL2	7093	97.70973	7093.0	tolloid like 2		This gene encodes an astacin-like zinc-dependent metalloprotease and is a subfamily member of the metzincin family. Unlike other family members, a similar protein in mice does not cleave procollagen C-propeptides or chordin.	TLL2

CTSA	5476	97.33933	5476.0	cathepsin A		This gene encodes a member of the peptidase S10 family of serine carboxypeptidases. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants, at least one of which encodes a preproprotein that is proteolytically processed to generate two chains that comprise the heterodimeric active enzyme. This enzyme possesses deamidase, esterase and carboxypeptidase activities and acts as a scaffold in the lysosomal multienzyme complex. Mutations in this gene are associated with galactosialidosis.	CTSA
VAT1L	57687	94.81288	57687.0	vesicle amine transport 1 like			VAT1L
DPP10	57628	95.37884	57628.0	dipeptidyl peptidase like 10		This gene encodes a single-pass type II membrane protein that is a member of the S9B family in clan SC of the serine proteases. This protein has no detectable protease activity, most likely due to the absence of the conserved serine residue normally present in the catalytic domain of serine proteases. However, it does bind specific voltage-gated potassium channels and alters their expression and biophysical properties. Mutations in this gene have been associated with asthma. Alternate transcriptional splice variants, encoding different isoforms, have been characterized.	DPP10
